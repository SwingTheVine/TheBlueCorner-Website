            Introduction
          </div>
          <p class="content-p">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;r/place 2023, it was great guys.
            I had a great time in the Blue Corner this year, but now it is over.
            But, before I forget, I want to talk about what happened here so that we do not have to forget.
            This year was very dramatic and eventful and some even say the Blue Corner got the best story this year whether you know it or not.
            I am personally not the kind of person to say one piece of history is better than another, but this year sure has a poetic narrative that is easy for me to craft.
            Despite the fun we had though, and despite the lore that came out of it, I think most of us can agree that this was the worst r/place event to date.
            It took too long, was fairly derivative, started with a bad color palette, was infested with bots, and most of all it was simply meant to distract us from recent Reddit API changes.
            If you noticed, this year the logo for the blue corner and many other factions did not contain “r/” as part of that protest.
            We were no longer advertising subreddits, but communities that transcended reddit.
            This is the story of one of those communities, the Blue Corner.
          </p>
          <p class="content-p">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Now, I could just go into 2023, but I don&#x2019;t want to.
            I joined the Blue Corner last year in 2022, in the middle of the Tarik invasion.
            I joined because I hated the fact that he was turning the Blue Corner red, not so much because I was angry he attacked the Blue Corner, but because the red corner, if it is to exist, belongs in the top-right, not the bottom-right, so I was fine with this.
            After place ended I quickly wrote down my perspective on the 2022 event in a “partial history of the Blue Corner.” which is in the subreddit archives.
            Now, having been part of this community for a full year and then some, I want to do the opposite and write a “complete history of the Blue Corner”
            I have been doing some research this last year and I hope I can present a history of the blue corner that covers the three place events thus far, and then some.
            In this history I will also discuss place alternatives, because why not, but I hope to link to more complete histories at various points.
            Another reason I am doing this is because 2023 has alot of story elements that you cannot really understand unless you know the history of 2022, and many people may not be willing to study it, so I am including it here.
            I wish to explain how each place event affected the faction and how it was replicated in various place alternatives, particularly pxls.space which I am most familiar with, but I hope to focus on place.

            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Blue Corner is a very unique community in r/place history.
              It is part of a very unique group of communities which I will call “factions” that almost all emerged in 2017.
              Artpieces in r/place can very generally be divided into 3 groups: art, proper, which is any art piece that is not simply flag with defined dimensions and a limited size that is usually complex and naturally leaves room for more art; Flags and other national symbols, striped flags in particular can usually expand indefinitely but only in a single direction; and finally factions,
              factions are communities centered around colors or simple patterns that can hypothetically expand in all directions indefinitely, and because of this these factions are usually focused on territorial control.
              There are some gray areas and subgroups and nuances when categorizing communities and art pieces on r/place, but most objects in r/place fit more or less into one of these three categories, and of these three categories, factions are the rarest.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The most notable factions on r/place are the Void, Erase the Place, the Green Lattice, Rainbow road, and last, but most of all, the Blue Corner.
              All of these factions have one, very simple thing in common: they all emerged in 2017, and only in the early stages of 2017, when they were dominant.
              Notable factions that emerged after 2017 are either limited in scope, such as the green line, a linear faction like rainbow road which is more easily incorporated into other artworks, or are griefing tools, such as the purple void xQc made, or are otherwise streamer made, such as the quackity duck lattice.
              This displays an interesting picture, namely that 2017 had unique conditions that were uniquely favorable to the creation of these iconic factions, conditions that haven&#x2019;t been repeated since, and which will likely never be repeated again.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Early on, during the first place, the timer which forced you to wait 5 minutes to place a pixel was extremely restrictive.
              Most people did not have the patience to create an artwork of any significant size alone, and because people did not know what was coming before the event started, there were no communication tools which helped people organize their pixel placements to “create something more” as the place logo said.
              Because of this, initially the canvas was dominated by random pixels of random colors that were placed in random locations.
              The highest concentration of these random pixels occurred near the center and on every corner except the bottom-right, that&#x2019;s because even though the corners, like the center, were being dominated by chaos, from the very beginning the Blue Corner brought order to the bottom right.
              You can check the interactive time lapse (which is actually a pixel-lapse) for yourself.
              (<a href="https://freestlr.github.io/place/" target="_blank">Link</a>)
              Though the first non-white pixel on the bottom-right corner was not blue, but black, and then red, and then blue, the blue corner was not dominated by chaos at a time when every other corner was.
              Why was the Blue Corner so successful so early on?
              This seems like quite the mystery.
              Why was every other early “corner province” a chaotic assortment of random pixels while the Blue Corner was simply blue?
              The answer for this question may come, of all places, from r/europe.
              It seems that r/europe was the first faction to claim the bottom right corner.
              They sought to make an EU flag, but pretty quickly people started just making the corner blue instead, keeping the stars from getting placed, and eventually r/europe was absolutely incapable of achieving their goals in the bottom-right.
              The idea that the Blue Corner is the result of a failed attempt to build the EU flag is hilarious to me, but it just goes to show you how history can happen.
              (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/62moej/reddit_has_started_a_new_rthebuttonstyle/dfnss3n/" target="_blank">Source</a>)
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Blue Corner that the EU flag turned into quickly became very popular with r/place at around the same time as the great green box.
              Whether or not the Blue Corner or the Great Green Box was first is hard to determine, but most people say the Green box was the first structure to emerge on r/place, and this would make the Blue Corner the second community-made structure ever.
              At this time, the Blue Corner also made a colony near the Green Box which I will call “the outpost,” the location where /u/Andrewcshore315&#x2019;s narrative starts.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Factions similar to the Blue Corner and Great Green Box quickly emerged.
              There was the Rainbow Road, the Green Lattice, the Black Lattice, the Purple Blob, the Square Spiral, the other rainbow, pink lattice, the pink triangle, the pink and cyan square spiral, the yellow lattice, the red corner, and many more.
              Dozens of factions, most of which only appeared on the first r/place, were created as these simple patterns were all most people could co-ordinate in the first day or two of the event.
              Because people were not yet co-ordinated enough to make complex art pieces, the early stages of r/place looked more like a territorial control game, a war between various color-based and lattice factions fighting to be the largest things on the canvas as artwork and the occasional flag slowly formed around them.
              At this time, the Blue Corner was the largest faction, no, the largest community on r/place, and because of this, it became the largest empire on place, it controlled 1/8th of the canvas at its peak.
              This was the golden age of our corner, when nobody would fight us.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our success inspired imitation.
              In the top-right corner, the red corner formed, the second largest corner faction.
              On the bottom-left corner, the green corner formed, a mere alternate location for the Great Green Box faction, and the third largest corner faction.
              But, on the top left, a fourth faction formed, the smallest notable corner faction of 2017: the pink corner.
              The pink corner was a tiny contiguous territory of pixels that controlled roughly 1/5th of its local chaotic corner region before the Blue Corner highway reached the top-left corner.
              This primitive corner faction was not able to bring order to its chaos before it was destroyed by the Blue Corner.
              No, the Blue corner conquered the top-left and created a brand new colony.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The various imitators, primarily the red and green corner, offended the Blue Corner, so our faction decided to invade these corners with pixels of blue.
              These invasions succeeded and directly led to the complete destruction of the red and green corners, when they were covered with art.
              But, the top-left corner was a different story.
              The blue empire lost the top-left corner when the subreddit r/purplepxls organized an army to take over the top-left corner making it the purple corner, the rebel corner, and they beat back the blue.
              When the purple corner rebelled, they were able to succeed because the Blue Corner had not only reached the limit of the territory it could hold on to, despite it&#x2019;s size, but also fought offensive wars against other factions that were taking up precious pixels.
              Erase the place formed, destroying the highway of blue pxls that connected the top-left corner to the bottom right further weakening the Blue Corner&#x2019;s image on the canvas, but this was still the golden age.
              It was simply our first major conflicts: the corner wars, three distinct conflicts, 2 of which we won, one of which we lost, and the highway war which we lost.
              Even still, we grew larger and larger because our home base would not stop growing even as our colony died.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the midst of all these wars we changed our primary subreddit from r/bluecorner to r/thebluecorner, and then shortly after this, war began.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Many people want to go back to this time, they want to make a blue empire to rival the first on r/place, but I am here to be the bearer of bad news.
              That is unachievable.
              It always will be.
              Assuming that reddit gets better at killing bots, whether or not a faction can survive is dependent on how compelling its idea is to the user base of place.
              The fact that no factions are emerging in 2022 and 2023 shows that, now that people are able to co-ordinate, simple color-based, location based, and lattice based ideas are not stuff people are interested in promoting.
              Place-original content is falling out of fashion, people want to bring in stuff they find compelling outside of place.
              There is simply too many placers to make new factions, and because of the fact that factions no longer dominate, and never will, factions can&#x2019;t make enemies unless they commit completely to griefing, and griefing would endanger the true corner making a true “blue empire” a thing of the past.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But, don&#x2019;t think of it as something that will never come again, no.
              Realize that the time when simple patterns and colors dominated r/place was a truly one time thing, a unique experience, the only time colored empires could emerge.
              And what did the Blue Corner do?
              We were the faction that dominated the era when factions dominated the canvas.
              We are the empire of place, and our unique historical achievement can never be repeated by anyone else making us a permanent fixture in place history.
              We are the Blue Corner, we are the empire, and that can never be taken away.
              The Blue Corner, along with Rainbow Road and the Green Lattice, are the three great empires of place 2017, and no empires like us can ever emerge again, but of the three we achieved the largest size, 1/8th of the canvas, even if only for a time.
              The Blue Corner is not an empire, but it had an empire, and it had the best empire.
              We get to claim the title of empire and are more deserving of it than any other faction on place, but now in our current circumstance, we have the chance to claim a second title, a more noble one, the title of survivor.

            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When the Blue Corner was at it&#x2019;s peak, the streamer Destiny came online and he decided that he wanted to destroy us.
              I wonder why.
              Anyways, he told his viewers to target our logo and the true corner.
              His raid, even though it never covered the corner, destroyed our ability to defend ourselves, many of our soldiers were discouraged, and slowly, but surely, the Blue Corner was consumed by a multitude of artworks that took advantage of the chaos created by Destiny&#x2019;s raid.
              Artwork also began to invade the other corners, the red, the green, and the purple, and the green lattice began to change from a white to it&#x2019;s iconic black background.
              All of these changes after Destiny&#x2019;s raid signaled that the age of factions, of empires, of massive color-based expansion was coming to an end and the age of art was beginning.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Most of the factions which emerged early on in r/place were being destroyed at the same time as us, but afew survived, and I find it useful to point out how each of them survived.
              The void survived because it was primarily a nomadic griefing tool. It&#x2019;s original intent was to make the entire canvas black, a very normal goal for a faction, the natural enemy of r/erase the place which wanted to make the canvas white.
              Erase the place, or the white void, had a very different survival strategy.
              After the white void was destroyed by the American flag, erase the place took over a small triangle in the nook of rainbow road, a controlled but deadly force.
              Rainbow road, on the other hand, never collapsed because it&#x2019;s linear design made it able to creatively co-operate with other art pieces.
              Green Lattice, on the other hand, was able to survive by becoming a nice looking background for small allied art pieces while Square Spiral was able to survive the end of the age of factions because it was so large and because it looked good.
              The Blue corner, on the other hand, was as good as dead...
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But we survived.
              Our faction consolidated it&#x2019;s efforts, it focused on rebuilding the logo to tell the world that we were still here and it defended the true corner to show that it would protect its home.
              When it came to defense, the faction was split on whether the logo or the corner was more important to defend, but once the logo was secured the faction was able to carve out a small territory by the true corner and slowly, but surely, reclaimed a small territory for its own under our logo.
              As we reclaimed our territory, we were divided between people who wanted to incorporate some artwork under the logo and those who wished to destroy it all.
              Eventually, those who wanted a clean corner won.
              We were also divided on whether we wanted a blue empire reborn or merely a presence on the canvas, but we were far to deep in the age of art for a new color empire to emerge, so we remained content with our 100x100 space.

              The Legacy of the 2017 Blue Corner
            </div>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The events of 2017 defined the faction in so many ways that can still be felt today.
              Most notably, our basic concept: blue in a corner, comes from 2017, but what that means has changed.
              Originally, we were the blue empire based in the corner, the corner was our home, but we were blue first and foremost, and an empire.
              Our victory was not defined by the purity of our corner as it has been in later ages, but by the size of our faction.
              Our ability to succeed in this way, the fact that we created the largest empire in the age of factions, was very important for ensuring our survival in both 2017 and in later place events.
              Even though we never would, and never could be an empire again, when the age of factions was over each faction needed to come up with a reason why it should survive, and of all the factions that did survive, the Blue Corner is the one that seemed like it should have died.
              Why should we, a faction of pure blue, have the corner?
              What could we do?
              Would we be a background and center of an alliance like green lattice?
              No.
              Would we be creatively incorporated into other artworks like rainbow road?
              No.
              Would we be migrating griefers like the void?
              Definitely not.
              So what were we?
              We became a monument to the continued legacy of the largest empire by portion of canvas controlled in place history, a celebration of all things place.
              We were the faction with the most prestigious legacy, so we had a reason, no, a duty, to survive.
              So we fought back and we claimed our space.
            </p>

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But the blue empire ultimately only gave a reason why we should survive, why we belonged on every place canvas from the first to the third, and if there&#x2019;s a fourth that to.
              But, what would that place look like?
              That was decided in the tumultuous chaos of the reclamation.
              Our faction had many parties that still exist today.
              There are the imperialists on one hand who want to relive the great legacy by creating a new empire, and the monumentalists on the other who desire a sufficient defendable space to honor the great legacy; there are the purists who desire a pure blue corner with no art on the one hand, and there are the incorporationists who desire to let in artwork of various kinds, control it, and make the blue corner a beautiful piece of art in its own right.
              The old empire, according to the 2017 historian /u/sarosauce, was imperialist, but it was also incorporationist, which many people use to justify the position that artwork should be in the modern blue corner.
              However, during the reclamation, the Blue Corner became purist and monumentalist.
              It had too few men to become an empire, but the Discord which is generally monumentalist and incorporationist, did not have enough knights to stop what is called “the reddit hivemind” in the Discord, the hivemind in general is characterized and imperialist and purist.
              The purist tendencies of the non-Discord users outweigh the incorporationist aspirations of the Discord leadership while the simple lack of manpower in the Blue Corner prevented the Blue Corner, both then and now, from becoming an empire a second time, so the Blue Corner is monumentalist and purist today.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There were five years between r/place 1 and r/place 2.
            During this time, nobody knew r/place would return in 2017, but some people, who were usually members of factions, did not want to let place go, they wanted to do it again.
            Because of this, many place alternatives were created, the best of which, in my opinion, is pxls.space.
            There were others, but I will mainly cover this alternative in my history.
          </p>
          <p class="content-p">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Unlike reddit where you can place one pixel every 5 minutes, pxls.space allows you to place one pixel every 30 seconds give or take.
            Besides this, the game is also allows you to store up to 6 pixels which means, if you don&#x2019;t place down a pixel, a hidden timer will slowly count down and give you a second pixel, and a third, and a fourth.
            The space between each pixel takes longer and longer until you have 6 pixels and are not able to gain any more pixels after that point.
            This “pixel chest” unique to pxls.space makes it a very different experience, especially when there is less than a hundred players online at any given time.
            The pxls.space canvases also tend to remain up for about a month before they are taken down and replaced by a brand new canvas which have become increasingly unique over time.
            Some of these canvases are fairly uninteresting and don&#x2019;t play that differently from a square, but many truly unique ideas take place on the pxls.space canvases.
            It is going to be my goal to outline the history of the various “governments” which directed the Blue Corner on pxls.space and what generally happened.
            Again, I don&#x2019;t know enough about other place alternatives from this era to write about them.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Initially, r/TheBlueCorner did not wish to discuss place alternatives on their subreddit, so a new subreddit emerged called r/Blupxls which organized the Blue Corner on pxls.space and other r/place alternatives.
              They had a good showing in canvas 1, but due to an invasion by the greens and a last minute void attack, the Blue Corner on canvas 1 was destroyed.
              On canvas 2, the Blue Corner was not able to gain a foothold due to the power of “the New Pixel Axis,” the villains of the first two canvases, and it remained insignificant on Canvas 3 due to the red lattice.
              On canvas 4, it did not exist because the canvas was a circle.

              The faction would continue in 30 and 30a (a unique transitional canvas that lasted for a very brief period of time) only to be discontinued and then re-continued during canvas 37.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And that is all the Blue Corner did at this time.
              As I write down the history of the Blue Corner on pxls Space I notice just how lackluster each and every one of these revivals are.
              They are each interesting in their own right, but man there is not much information, nor was there much success, in these revivals.
              Many of these revivals were only inspired by the Blue Corner and none of them properly adapted to the conditions of pxls space which inevitably led to their downfall.
              However, the Blue Corner would return to pxls.space, and it would do so better than ever.
              During this first interregnum, the Green Lattice appeared, great or small, on almost every single pxls.space canvas and their ideology became the prominent ideology in pxls.space.
              Pxls.space is a place alternative where every faction draws backgrounds or art or both and backgrounds must always give way to art.
              Each blue corner revival adapted to this meta to some extent, but none were very successful for very long during this period.
              Even though the Green Lattice has been pushed out of pxls.space today, they are still the source of this alternative&#x2019;s modern culture.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With our plans intact, we immediately took over a large area in the bottom-right corner.
              While we were expanding, a line of Amongi (people have stopped using this term) invaded our territory which started the first Amongus war, a war we quickly won.
              During this war, we also gained Cosmere as allies and decided to cede some of our territory over to them.
              Besides cosmere, we were also neighbors to Eminem, r/placetrees, a line of turtles, and some Ukraine hearts.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We did not become a massive empire stretching across an eighth of the canvas, but even still at this time we were about the same size as the late Blue Corner in 2017 despite the fact that there were now more people in place.
              We returned, and it is reasonable to ask and answer one more time why we were able to return after a five year hiatus.
              What was so compelling about the Blue Corner that caused people to join it, that caused it to re-appear in 2022?
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I have a few ideas for why the Blue Corner is so compelling.
              Firstly, the Blue Corner on r/place 2017 was so absurd.
              It was so plain!
              How could there be an entire faction dedicated to making a corner blue?
              How could it possibly be this big?
              This stark contrast was a natural advertisement to those on the canvas, an advertisement that would compel many to look deeper, and then they learned of the Blue Empire.
              They learned what a place icon we were, and that made us respected, it showed place that we belonged even if we did not seem to fit at first glance.
              Not only did we belong, we were distinctive, and we as a faction help to define what place is.
              The essential “placeness” of our faction also helped encourage many 2017 veterans to rejoin the corner for the event.
              There is an inherent sense of place-based digital nationalism inherent in this faction which inspires members to fight for the faction again and again, making other artworks seem unimportant and secondary in comparison.
              The sense of loyalty is very strong in this faction, I feel it too, and it is kind of surprising.
              It is fascinating how people can unite over making a corner blue.
              I don&#x2019;t know exactly how this works, but it seems joining the faction helps people identify with a piece of internet history and makes them feel more important than they honestly have a right to be.
              It&#x2019;s all just fun and games, but to some extent it does not feel that way.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I do have to say, as someone who joined this year, the Blue Corner is a fun faction to take seriously in a playful way, as much as that makes sense.
              The faction has an interesting, unique dynamic, clear goals, and has had a unique set of enemies and stories it has had to face throughout the years.
              It is a fun team to play with on place, it is fun to help the team achieve victory in the way that we have defined it.
              It is awesome how we won, in our monumentalist definition of winning, three events in a row, how we achieved our faction goals and were respected for it.
              Even though factions no longer dominate place, we still retain that factional sense of “winning” and “losing” that inspires people to fight and to not give up, to try even when it gets hard, and ultimately to achieve our goals.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Those goals, in this iteration of r/place, were to keep the True Corner blue, keep the logo up, keep the border secure, and keep the land pure.

                &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;The Lattice Wars
              </div>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Blue Corners design was based on its design at the end of r/place 2017.
                At this time, the blue corner was a region of blue pixels surrounded by a light blue, lattice-like border wall which included the faction logo.
                This was a very visually pleasing design, but it backfired.
                The blue lattice border-wall was only partially built during 2017, but it was fully built during the start of 2022.
                Very quickly, this completed lattice gained a mind of its own and started invading the Blue Corner.
                There were three lattice wars in total.
                During the first two, the lattice invaded the Blue corner, the Blue corner fought back, won, and we thought we had it under control, so the war ended.
                We were wrong, so a second war started, then a third.
                When the third war started, we decided this wouldn&#x2019;t stop being a problem, so we decided to destroy our beautiful lattice and replace it with a safe black border instead.
                The offensive which caused the destruction of the blue lattice was called the X-911 offensive after the coordinates where it occurred, X-911y. During this offensive, the “balls 1st division” would attack along the X-911 splitting the Blue Lattice in two.
                The faction would then conquer the northern half of the lattice and then the southern half.
                By this offensive, the lattice was quickly destroyed.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You may notice if you watch the Blue corner timelapse (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZvgggcPqGY" target="_blank">Link</a>) closely that, even though the lattice invaded the Blue Corner four times during the lattice wars, only three wars are counted.
                Well, I believe this is a simple oversight.
                Three lattice wars are counted, but on the timelapse you can see 4 distinct times when the blue lattice clearly expanded into the Blue Corner and one of those occurred during a period labeled “peacetime.”
                The invasion directly after this first war, which I will call “the lost lattice war” was clearly forgotten because it was significantly smaller than all the rest, but you can clearly see on the timelapse the lattice outgrowing itself and the Blue Corner performing tactical decisions to fight it.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Also, you may want to know who was responsible for the Lattice wars.
                The answer is, we don&#x2019;t know. There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be a faction responsible for the four lattice wars on the first corner, thought there almost certainly was some group responsible for the fifth lattice war on the second corner, but we just do not know who that group is, so in the end we say each lattice war was a period in which the Blue Corner saw the lattice as hostile and either defended against it or attacked it, but we do not know if there was a faction that had a constant attitude of aggression towards the Blue Corner that would make this all one conflict.
                You will note late on in this history in 2023 that, when I discuss Zugu, I will say that though there were multiple distinct invasions, like with the lattice wars, it was all one war because Zugu was aggressive toward us for a continuous period that encompassed all the invasions making every invasion a single long war.
                Other wars, such as the Amongi wars and the Bratishkinoff wars were distinct wars because they were not prolonged periods, but distinct episodes of conflict.
                I will note that essentially every conflict the Blue Corner experienced during r/place 2022 was a distinct episode and not a prolonged period, however it is quite interesting that all the lattice wars occurred at a single period when no other conflict occurred.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One of the most interesting questions about the lattice wars is simple.
                Why was it that, during the lattice wars, the Blue Corner was only griefed by the Blue Lattice?
                This is an interesting question because I think it reveals something about the psychology of griefers.
                As events in the future will show, some people just don&#x2019;t like the Blue Corner, and they generally say it is because the corner is so plain.
                Some people probably saw this design right next to the blue corner, said “this is prettier” and decided to expand it into the blue corner instead of building their own art because this alternative design was already well established.
                When other griefers saw the design expanding into the blue corner, they didn&#x2019;t so much care about making their own distinctive mark as joining a side that seemed it was already bringing the blue corner down.
                The Blue Lattice, in it&#x2019;s short history, even though it griefed the Blue Corner, also seemed to protect the Blue Corner from other griefs, and evidence for this griefing lightning rod of the blue lattice can also be found in the next episode, the QRMongus war, which might be the best proof that the Blue lattice, despite all it&#x2019;s problems, helped to keep our corner clean, potentially more than it hurt?
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I personally find it quite sad that the lattice was destroyed.
                It was a nice, distinctive border that really added to the aesthetic of the corner.
                If I had the power, I could bring it back.
                But such beauty seems to come at the price of constant war, and this price was ultimately something we were unwilling to pay, so we gave up our blue lattice and exchanged it for a boring, generic, but safe single pixel border.
                Originally, the border was a shade of blue, but eventually it became and remained a generic black border.
                But the black border did save us from being invaded by our own border, but the thin border also made territorial disputes with our neighbors more common, so it has its tradeoffs which never perfectly prevented civil war.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After the Lattice was destroyed, a curious event happened.
                The void returned, a fact that is not too surprising considering the fact that some people will always want to see the world burn.
                However, the surprising fact is that members of the Blue Corner Discord apparently performed an unprovoked raid on the Void&#x2019;s Discord server needlessly antagonizing them.
                The balls 1st division, the ones that performed the x-911 offensive, was responsible for this idiotic Discord raid.
                Even though they did good for us at the start, man was this dumb, and even though the Blue Corner diplomats were able to smooth over the situation, it still caused the void to temporarily declare us enemies.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Besides this unseemly event, right after the Blue Lattice was destroyed, the amount of “confetti” in the corner started to grow rapidly while we also began to infringe on the territory of neighboring communities.
                Then, it became clear that a vast multitude of assorted communities were expanding into our corner, possibly seeing the destruction of the lattice as a sign of “expansionists intentions” among the Blue Corner.
                Soon, it became clear that the rickroll QR code was the most powerful community of invaders, so we quickly made a deal with them to allow them a place in our corner in exchange for them shrinking the size of their QR code and moving it away from the true corner.
                We would eventually make a second deal to change the location of the code and change it to a shade of blue, but this plan would fall apart when the first expansion occurred.

              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/u/chippedjosh notes 4 distinct groups who invaded our corner at this time:
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;1.&ensp;The QR code
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;2.&ensp;A collection of Amongi
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;3.&ensp;Rogue trees
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;4.&ensp;Miscellaneous groups.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The miscellaneous groups can be distinguished by the distinct artworks they made, but there is atleast 17 unique co-ordinated groups expanding in the Blue besides the three already directly specified, and on top of this the last remnant of the Blue Lattice on the top right beside the logo expanded into the Blue Corner meaning that the fifth lattice war, by my count, but not by the traditional count, also occurred at this time.
                I believe that the most common name for this period of chaos is the “QR code war,” but I prefer what I believe to be the second most popular term for this war “the QRMongus war.”
                The first name comes from the fact that the QR code was the principle enemy of the Blue Corner, but it should be noted that for a large portion of this conflict we had a treaty with the QR code and were at war with other factions for most of the period.
                The name “QRMongus” is a combination of the 2 principle invaders of the war, the QR code and Amongi and signals the fact that there were multiple groups involved in this war, but you would have to study to know that during this conflict the Blue Corner was technically invaded by atleast 20 distinct groups of various sizes and confetti all at the same time.
                However, for future reference I will also need to note that this war technically includes both the second Amongus war and the Fifth Lattice War.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After we made peace with the QR code, we defeated the second most relevant enemy, the Amongi, and then cleared out the miscellaneous invaders.
                Once we dealt with the miscellaneous groups, we were in a better position to make a deal with the QR code and have them move to the bottom left of our territory and change to Azure and Blue instead of black and white.
                However, we never pushed the rogue trees out of the Logo region they overran partly because they were strong, but mainly because the canvas expanded shortly after this.
                The rogue trees ultimately kept the land they conquered, the only invader to gain any permanent territory, as when the canvas expanded we gave our old territory to Quebec, a flag that was in the center of the original canvas but was pushed out due to constant war with other factions.
                In an almost poetic twist of fate, us handing over the old blue corner to them would cause them to not only gain a permanent and largely undisputed territory, but it also placed them in the exact center of the final canvas making their early defeat in those “king of the hill wars” that took place in the early central canvas be their ticket to become the undisputed king of the top of the final hill.
                Quebec, you are welcome.
                I am glad our old corner turned into you.
                This, in a sense, gave both us and you a prominent position in the center of the final canvas, but it was ultimately the whims of fate that gave this gift to us.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am both sad and glad that the canvas expanded at this time.
                The reason I am sad is because the QR Code was the only faction that has ever offered to build art on the blue corner that is strong enough to keep it there.
                If we had remained on that corner longer and been forced to accept the QR code, then that might have been a catalyst to reform the blue corner and help make it incorporations.
                After that, in both 2022 and 2023, opportunities never arose to make the blue corner an art friendly place, to make it incorporate some artworks in a unique way.
                Yes, the Amongi were ultimately strong enough to force their way into our corner, but they were ultimately to repetitive and dominating for us to allow them in the corner.
                On to five amongi positioned in a clever way meant to play out some scene in the blue corner would be something I could appreciate, but you cannot hide amongi in the blue corner and the Amongus community was not very creative with how they placed them so they were nothing but a rash on the pure blue canvas.
                The QR code was the first artwork that had a real chance of being incorporated into the core territory of the Blue Corner ever since the first Blue Corner civil war back in 2017, and ever since then the Blue Corner has never had a chance to creatively incorporate artwork inside it.
                But I am also glad that the Blue Corner moved and that the expansions happened because of the stories they opened, and because the expansions also helped to sate the expansionist appetites of other communities which helped the Blue Corner to keep the role on r/place it had carved out for itself.

              We moved to the new bottom-right corner.
              Some people were confused, yes, but generally the faction knew what it was doing, so we were quickly able to reclaim our rightful space and two great things happened because of it.
              Firstly, we didn&#x2019;t have to negotiate with the QR code, and secondly we were able to take over a territory that was maybe as much as twice the size of our first corner, a great achievement!
              However, the corner would soon host the most difficult challenges faced by the faction yet.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Not much of note happened on the second corner until the streamer Tarik decided to invade the Blue Corner.
                He sought to turn it red, then purple, and ultimately to draw a self-portrait on our corner.
                As I mentioned earlier, I joined during the Tarik invasion and my previous narrative, a partial history of the Blue Corner, started here.

                I would encourage you to read it as, even though this history will cover the same events, that will have a different, shorter, and more concise narrative I do not with to repeat here.
                I was there for the whole story.
                I saw the Blue Corner turn red, then purple.
                I saw us fight the text, cover up his face, but ultimately, I saw as call in the Void to destroy him, one of the most based strategic moves the Blue Corner ever did.
                We called them in, asked them to turn three quarters of our territory black, cause Tarik to leave us alone, and to just not destroy the True Corner.
                They did this, it wasn&#x2019;t as good as turning our territory blue again, but it was good enough. The Void destroyed Tarik and then they moved on, leaving us to clean up the rest.
                It was beautiful.

              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was during this time that my “character arc” started of course.
                Due to the events of 2023 and the fact that I am now a mod on Discord, I will not claim I was unimportant to the history of the faction, in fact I believe I was very important, though I had more of an affect as a non-mod than I did as a mod. (I will explain later)
                Anyways, over the course of 2022, I saw that the Blue Corner was very, very disorganized and it was my hope to help re-organize the blue corner.
                I succeeded beyond my wildest dreams to the point that it ultimately landed me a mod role, but I need to start talking about it now because this is when the initial seedling of the idea that would be the “four unit system” first came into being.
                The four unit system was part of the organizational structure of the Blue Corner at the end of 2022 and for all of 2023, but it started here with the concept of the “True Corner Knights.”
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Or actually, I should say it started in 2017 with the debates about whether or not defending the logo or the true corner was more important for the faction.
                Ideas were being thrown around even at that time of a unit specifically meant to defend the logo...
                No, the earliest proposal for something like a unit specifically meant to defend the logo was thrown around on the first day of r/place by /u/cooltrain7 on r/bluecorner, our first subreddit!
                (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueCorner/comments/62p82r/we_need_a_banner_clean_up_crew/" target="_blank">Link</a>)
                However, this proposal got nowhere in the end and the Blue Corner remained largely unorganized until 2022.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Basically, when I fought in the Tarik war, I saw that we found the True Corner to be very important, but it seemed to me that far to many people were placing on the true corner pixel.
                We did not need the whole faction on it, even in the midst of a massive raid, to keep it true blue most of the time.
                We only needed like... ten people I thought.
                We could do more, be stronger if only others did not place on the true corner.
                So, I proposed to the faction that we make a unit of 10 people to defend the true corner and tell everyone else to stop doing it.
                Nowadays, with more experience under my belt, I realize that the Knights of the True Corner should be the only people on the Discord placing on the True Corner as those not on the Discord can&#x2019;t be told to not place there, and we did receive enough help from the disorganized knights to simply make it the case where the rest of the Discord didn&#x2019;t to have that many people on the true corner to keep it blue.
                The disorganized knights, though, are ultimately critical to keeping the true corner pixel blue most of the time.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Anyways, my suggestion of creating the True Corner Knights largely got ignored.
                However, I knew I had a good idea, it&#x2019;s just nobody would listen.
                I eventually decided that the Blue Corner was largely governed by consensus anyways, and if I made an informal group I had a good argument for why it should exist and why people should respect it so, at some point, I am not sure if it was between the Tarik or xQc invasions or if it was between the xQc and 5opka invasions, but I decided that I would found the Knights of the True Corner by putting “true corner knight 1/10” in my Discord server nickname to show I was the first and how many recruits I wanted.
                I then tried to get recruits for my unit, tried to vet them by timezone, and I believe there were 9-11 members of my unit by the end of it.
                Anyways, this is initially how the Knights of the True Corner organized.
                Our main goal was to ensure that the rest of the Discord knew they didn&#x2019;t need to worry about the True Corner and could go and do other things, and we constantly reminded them of this, and leading this group is what my participation in the faction mostly consisted of during 2022 until the adoption in the 4 unit system which comes much, much later.
                Anyways, that is the origin of the Knights of the True Corner, the oldest unit of the 4 unit system and the reason why I started it.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Anyways, after the end of the Tarik invasion, a very notable event happened and I am surprised all the other histories of 2022 fail to mention it, just like they fail to mention the first Amongus war.
                Even though I was awake during this conflict, I forgot about it!
                That would be a civil war that happened within the Blue Corner.
                Basically, in the midst of the confusion that was going on while we were rebuilding from the fact that we called the Void in to destroy Tarik, some Azure pixels started being placed near the True Corner, and some people in the Discord started getting the strange idea that we were “changing shades” even though the mods had made no announcement about this, and people on Discord began to argue that we ought to change to this better shade of blue.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I, being a lover of history and tradition as I mentioned in the previous post, would have none of it.
                I joined the Blue Corner because the red corner tried to take over the bottom-right, completely going against place tradition!
                Take the top-right you red idiots!
                Anyways, I wasn&#x2019;t going to let the corner be turned red, black, or purple or this weird new shade of “blue” anytime soon.
                Of course, I didn&#x2019;t have much influence, but I did join in the cacophony of voices that insisted we were not changing color, and eventually the mods vindicated us, and eventually we defeated this weird Azure Angle people wanted to turn us into.
                It never took over more than a 25th of our territory, but the incident was still notable enough and could potentially be seen as a Blue Corner civil war.
                However, it may not be.
                I have a theory that the QR code faction may be partially responsible for this event.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I fell asleep in the midst of the aforementioned incident, so I was not awake to experience the next part.
                That next part was the xQc invasion.
                Essentially, xQc had decided to grief r/place, and earlier on during the second day he decided to go to war with OSU!, but after constantly losing to them he decided to grief the Blue Corner and the bottom-right region of the canvas surrounding it.
                This cemented him as a major villain of r/place and the fact that the Blue Corner was barely visible during his invasion likely demoralized his troops, but eventually he went offline, and when he went offline we retook our land, and when we retook our land he did not return.
                This invasion, this slaughter, helped to solidify another tenant of Blue Corner strategy.
                We may not have bots, we may not have streamers, we may not have numbers, but we don&#x2019;t just rely on our legacy to carry on to victory.
                No, we win in the end because we are persistent.
                Even if the enemy kills us we will come back again, we will not accept destruction.
                Just as we did in 2017, we will reclaim our land.
                Persistence and an unwillingness to give up is one of the defining characteristics of the Blue Corner and it has constantly let us come out on-top in the 2022 and 2023 meta of streamer invasions even if, for a moment, it looked like we were dead.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But, as inspiring as it was for our faction to come back from the dead, we still experienced alot of harm due to xQc&#x2019;s invasion that we could not recover from though xQc alone was not responsible.
                Many smaller factions took advantage of the chaos and the late-night timing of xQc&#x2019;s attack to establish their own territory in the Blue Corner as one million things happened at once.
                This period of Blue corner history was far more chaotic than the QRMongus war and with much worse consequences for the corner, but here is my best timeline of the events that happened.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Essentially, the Blue Corner tried to reclaim it&#x2019;s original territory, but abunch of incorrect shades of blue were being thrown in which slowed down the reclamation process.
                Smaller factions took advantage of this and began to reclaim territory.
                The Blue Corner, in response to this, began to build a border within it&#x2019;s own territory in order to avoid conflict with these factions, but this border collapsed.

                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Blue Corner also developed the weird habit at this time of building their logo extremely close to the bottom of their territory, endangering the integrity of the True Corner.
                  The width of the logo also came to largely define how wide the faction&#x2019;s territory would be, which is interesting, and divided the previously united blue field into two regions, a “core” region below the logo and a more expansive region above.
                  Whatever the case, the smaller logo and it&#x2019;s strange location helped to redefine the territory of the Blue Corner in a way that adapted to the coming balkanization.
                  When I woke up and pointed out how much territory we lost, I was told not to worry about it as we expected the canvas to expand again, which was reasonable considering the fact that when day 3 began, the canvas was both not square and already full of art.

                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While all this was going on, either the Blue Corner itself or some outside group decided to rebuild the Blue Lattice.
                  If it was the Blue Corner it was likely done to more clearly delineate it&#x2019;s new, smaller claim, but if it was done intentionally it was clearly a mistake as the lattice immediately began to outgrow it&#x2019;s designated size and invaded the territory of the Blue Corner beginning a sixth lattice war.
                  (This is generally considered to be the fourth, not the sixth, lattice war but this is because of the 2 aforementioned forgotten invasions.
                  That happened on the first corner.)
                  To combat this, the Blue Corner finally switched to using a generic black border and began the process of destroying the lattice one last time.

                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But, while the Blue Lattice still dominated the western territory of the Blue Corner and then some, the Amongi began to invade the eastern portion of our lands beginning the third Amongus war.
                  However, this is usually considered to be the second Amongus war either because the first war in 2022 was completely forgotten or, more likely, because they count the QRMongus war as something other than “the Second Amongus war” which is kind of nice because ignoring the fact that the QRMongus war was the second Amongus war means that each corner officially experienced a single Amongus war which is a very neat way to divide things, but it isn&#x2019;t true and that is really what matters.
                  The third Amongus war started here, on the second corner, and both the first and second took place on the first.

                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Anyways, as the Amongi invaded they came into conflict with the Blue lattice which means that the sixth lattice war quickly turned from being a war between the Blue Lattice and the Blue Corner to being a war between the Blue Lattice and the Blue Amongi over the Blue Corner.
                  If a name more catchy then the “Balkanization of the Blue Corner” is to be given to the entire conflict, then I guess the “Lattice-Amongus” war is the best name that can be given to this conflict as it reflects the primary participants in the conflict besides the Blue Corner, and despite the fact that the war happened on our territory we were really a minor player for most of the war.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Blue Corner was victorious in it&#x2019;s battle to redirect the green line, but the Amongi were victorious in their war against the lattice to overtake the Blue Corner.
                The Amongi even started expanding the Blue Corner and placing their Amongi in the expansion!
                But even though some toyed with the idea of accepting them, we ultimately knew that we had to destroy them, so we fought...
                And we fought.
                I joined an offensive led by the moderator q77e meant to push back against the Amongi, but we were never able to destroy the seventh Amongus under the logo, to the left of the True Corner before the third streamer of the corner, 5opka, invaded.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At first we didn&#x2019;t know what was going on because he used Cyan, a shade of blue.
                Some people again thought that it was a color change, but soon we figured out that we were being attacked by a Russian streamer named 5opka.
                Quickly, we figured out that we could not fight him, so we defended the true corner with all our might, but people began to think we might finally lose.
                Some people mentioned calling on the Void, but that was a 1 time thing.
                We could not do it again.
                However, there was hope that the canvas would expand soon, after all we knew it ought to expand...

                We fought a hopeless war, but we were saved by the bell.
                The canvas expanded, 5opka stayed put and we conquered a new territory at the new bottom-right of the canvas.

                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, just like the story with 1k,1k didn&#x2019;t end when the Blue Corner left, but instead Quebec took over, so to the story of 2k,1k wasn&#x2019;t over, but this time 5opka, our invader, took over.
                  Now, from the remnants of our old corner, 5opka expanded, quadrupling in size taking new quadrants to the west and south of our second location.
                  This region became the battleground of streamers for most of the remainder of place, but the northern section of the Blue Corner which we lost during the xQc invasion remained free for smaller communities to control.
                  I find this fact interesting because it is likely the case that, if xQc did not invade us, then we would of retained our whole territory until the 5opka invasion and then our whole territory would have been lost to streamers until the end of r/place, but because the xQc invasion caused us to lose that territory many small communities were able to find a place for themselves and remained safe, though they were on the border of streamer wars, for the rest of the event, so the smaller communities of our northern former corner can thank us for giving up that territory after the invasion as it gave them a permanent place on the canvas, and not a transitional one like their south-western brothers.
                </p>
                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As for the streamers which fought in “the 5opka region” or “the southern second corner” and the “post-corner region?”
                  Well, after 5opka went offline, small communities began to take over, but before the transition was complete, a supposedly streamer-made self-portrait of a guy who calls himself “Messiave” was made.
                  A pukish-green pattern made by a streamer I can&#x2019;t identify then took over the the territory and then the territory expanded south.
                  The french then (attacked?) the region by placing baguettes on it before it was taken over by the streamer IKOI.
                  IKOI&#x2019;s logo was then covered up with a picture of a penis... and then a baby with the word “Peace” and a heart under it, and then after one last french grief it was taken over by a bunch of small arts and a small Void.
                  The rapid changes on the canvas and the presence of the french indicates that an underrated and very interesting streamer war took place here.
                  I wonder if someone else will investigate.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Right after the canvas expanded we immediately made our way over to the new corner, leaving the old corner to whatever fate may befall it.
              Sure, it may have been preferable for the second Blue Corner to be given to a semi-related faction like Quebec so that the Blue world order&#x2019;s influence may be clearly seen in that place on the final canvas, and not merely subtly seen by means of careful analysis of the timelapse.
              However, we were just glad that the expansion saved our corner, and our legacy, from the overwhelming 5opka invasion.
              At the same time that we were expanding, a group of French streamers made a massive French Flag on the bottom-left portion of the canvas.
              Even though this was annoying to most r/place communities, I and many other members of the Blue Corner realized that this event was truly a stroke of amazing luck on our part as many streamers had targeted us in the past because “we were so boring,” but this French flag would be a truly irresistible target for any streamers on r/place and would divert their attention away from us.
              This prediction turned out to be true as streamer after streamer joined in the great French Flag war of 2022 and because the remainder of our history mostly dealt with neighbors rather than random third party streamers coming in and destroying our place.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The neighbors of the third and final Blue Corner of r/place are very notable for afew reasons.
                Firstly, our last neighborhood was very different from the first two neighborhoods we resided in during r/place 2022.
                In both the first and second corner, the Blue Corner had Cosmere as a neighbor to our northwest, some hearts as our northern neighbors with either the german flag or german allies above them, and abunch of smaller factions to the southwest.
                On this final corner, we only had two neighbors: r/AmericanFlagInPlace and the streamer Bratishkinoff.
                Each of these neighbors, particularly Bratishkinoff, was very important for the later history of the Blue Corner, so I find it important to discuss both of them at the start of this section, starting with the American Flag.

              <!-- r/AmericanFlagInPlace -->
              <div id="r-americanflaginplace">
                <div class="history-sub-sub-sub-subheader">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;r/AmericanFlagInPlace
                </div>
                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;r/AmericanFlagInPlace started 2022 in the center of the old canvas, quadrant 1, which early on was the primary battleground of r/place.
                  The Old Center wars are another of those under-discussed events in r/place history that are clearly very interesting if you look at the timelapse.
                  During those wars, a bunch of national flags were battling for their place in the center of r/place&#x2019;s canvas, and the twists and turns of the conflict were numerous as different flags who were losing the war began to migrate away and find more secure locations on the canvas.
                  Ukraine was the first major loser of the Old Center wars because their massive flag near the top of the canvas made their secondary locations seem redundant and pointless, so the Ukraine flag in the old center was quickly covered up by the rest of the communities in that region.
                </p>
                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Quebecois were the second big losers in the region.
                  They had already been firmly pushed out of the old center by Turkey long before the canvas expanded, but their defeat ultimately turned into victory since, as I mentioned before, we gave them our old corner when the canvas expanded and that allowed Quebec to take over the actual center of the canvas.
                </p>
                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But neither Ukraine or Quebec experienced the most griefing in the old center during those conflicts.
                  No, the most heavily attacked flag in the Old Center was the American flag, which is strange considering the fact that r/AmericanFlagInPlace is the least expansionist American Flag faction out there.
                  Basically, r/AmericanFlagInPlace tries to follow the US flag codes as exactly as possible, so even though their striped pattern would hypothetically allow them to expand infinitely to the right considering Place flag traditions, r/AmericanFlagInPlace does not accept this possibility for expansion as such extended proportions would go against the US flag codes.
                  This means that the American Flag was the least threatening flag in the region, but they were still constantly attacked from all sides and by the Void.
                  If I am being very honest, the constant attacks on the American Flag do seem to be a product of how popular Anti-Americanism tends to be worldwide which made the American Flag the least offensive flag to grief for most people, including Americans, which caused them to have the hardest time in the old center.
                </p>
                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When the Canvas expanded for the second time, r/AmericanFlagInPlace decided that it was time to change locations.
                  A new set of coordinates popped up, and these coordinates were more American than ever: 1776, 1776.
                  America decided that now was the time to give up their position in the old corner which was heavily contested and to hopefully find a permanent place for themselves on this canvas.
                  In the end, they were very successful in their goal.
                  A few important things happened when they made this move.
                  Firstly, the American flag did find a good location at the right time.
                  Not only were they neighbors to the Blue Corner, which would make them noticeable to every place veteran, they were also not attacked nearly as much after they moved.
                  Secondly, the wars in the old center started to draw to a close as the remaining factions became content with dividing up the space left over by the American Flag, with Chile, a complete wildcard, taking over most of it, and with other flags, namely the french one, drawing the attention of most of the canvas.
                </p>
                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When the American Flag moved, they incidentally became our neighbors.
                  I do not believe the fact that they were near the Blue Corner influenced their decision to move there at all, but they did take us into account once they did.
                  They immediately became our allies and they remained so for the remainder of place, but not much important stuff in our diplomatic history happens after they become our allies which is why I wrote so much about them in this section.

                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our second neighbor was the Russian streamer Bratishkinoff. I won&#x2019;t write so much about him here firstly because I do not know much about what he was doing before he became our neighbor, and secondly because he is so central to the remainder of our history that giving him too much of an introduction here would just be unfair.
                  He became our ally at one point, but this fell apart for reasons that will become apparent.
                  The only important thing to note so far is that the streamer respected us and did not try to destroy us.
                  This simple act has made our relationship with Bratishkinoff far better than our relationship with any other streamer and people in the Blue Corner tend to have far better opinions of him than the rest of Place has.
                  If you aren&#x2019;t from the Blue Corner and don&#x2019;t like Bratishkinoff because of his other actions, such as griefing Genshin, and can&#x2019;t imagine why the Blue Corner likes him so much (and honestly it got a little too much in 2023) just remember that every time the Blue Corner interacted with a streamer up to this point, that streamer was actively attempting to destroy the Blue Corner, and many did.
                  Destiny, Tarik, xQc, and 5opka, all of them destroyed us.
                  Sure, Mizkif did help us fight Tarik because, when we called on the Void, he was part of that faction and helped us abit because of that.
                  But really, our interactions with Bratishkinoff would end up being the best interactions we ever had with streamers up to that point, so “Bratishkinoff” is a name that means something very different to the Blue Corner than to other communities.
                  From our perspective, he was the only streamer decent to us, and because of our limited view we saw him, for a time, as the only decent streamer.

                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The final thing I will not is that he drew a self-portrait of himself by our corner where he was wearing a frog hat, atleast I think it was kinda a self-portrait.
                  Because of his art, the Blue Corner called him “frog guy” for the entirety of 2022 because it was just easier to remember than “Bratishkinoff.”

                  The Blue Corner, for the first time ever, wasn&#x2019;t square, but a rectangle far taller than it was wide.
                  Also, the logo was again placed very close to the bottom of our territory, something that annoyed me for the entire event.
                  However, despite these problems, there was one nice thing that happened.
                  The territories of Bratishkinoff, the Blue Corner, and American Flag in Place all formed a neat square around the bottom-right creating a sort of “extended bottom right corner”

              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After a short period where all the people in the bottom right were setting up, a group of “disorganized knights,” that is knights which are not on Discord and therefore cannot easily be directed by the Discord, began to encroach upon the territory of Bratishkinoff.
                After this reached a critical point, the streamer decided to attack the Blue Corner with a flood of white pixels in order to “teach us a lesson”.
                And that he did do.
                He focused on destroying the logo, and once that was done and the corner in general was in chaos, he stopped the attack.
                He did not wish to destroy us, just punish us for not controlling our borderlands.
                This is the first time our simple black border caused conflicts with our neighbors, something the wider blue lattice might have prevented.

              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The most important consequence of this war was that it destroyed our logo, and for some reason in the process of rebuilding the logo it inexplicably moved seven pixels to the left.
                It was probably when this war occurred that I first realized the Blue Corner would need a sort of “Knights of the Blue Logo” and “Knights of the Blue Border” to properly manage its territory and prevent future wars.
                It was at this time that I probably started proposing a 4 unit system, but the system would take some more time to develop.
                I will also note that between this and the next conflict, the United States expanded their flag southward.

              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Shortly after we began to rebuild, something strange happened.
                Bratishkinoff, the streamer, decided to make the background of his frog guy art blue.
                We don&#x2019;t know why he did this, we did not ask him to, but he did.
                According to my old history, the streamer thought we were similar to a faction on a Russian alternative of r/place that was meant to be a background to art, and it was undoubtedly also meant to be a symbol of friendship.
                This turned out to be a very 89 move.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Wait, what do I mean by 89 move?
                Well, basically, at this time, he also wrote the numbers “89” beside the frog guy.
                Abunch of redditors obviously tried to turn this into 69, but his community wanted it to say 89.
                Why?
                Well, we were confused at first to, but eventually we learned that “89” was the score he got an an iq test he did on stream once, so his chat often spammed that number in the chat when he did something stupid.
                Hopefully in line with that tradition I tend to jokingly refer to his actions that are both dumb and very well-intentioned as “89 move” or to him as “89” when he is doing them, and it seems to catch on some.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Well, why was this move so 89?
                It turns out, because the Blue Corner just couldn&#x2019;t be content with a good thing.
                Even though Bratishkinoff&#x2019;s gift allowed the Blue Corner to be an empire a second time, and it again gave the Blue Corner an opportunity to become incorporationist, there is a problem with streamer-made art.
                Namely, the problem is that the streamer&#x2019;s community only tends to be as active on the canvas as the streamer is.
                Once the streamer is gone, his defenses tend to collapse.
                It was also the case that the Blue Corner has alot of knights with puritanical tendencies.
                They didn&#x2019;t want the blue corner to be a background to art, but to be the art (the very ideology the Green Lattice had to get rid of to remain an empire in 2017).
                However, the leadership on Discord, both the vc and the mods, wanted to remain his background, so they fought back against the disorganized knights and tried (and failed) to convince people on reddit to stop attacking frog guy!
                The thing is, we were afraid that if froggy&#x2019;s art was destroyed, when the streamer woke up he would see it and take vengeance on us and destroy our corner completely, something we knew he was capable of doing from our first war with him.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When this war began is unclear because of how smooth the transition was from “becoming his background” to “destroying his art.”
                The official 2022 timelapse of the blue corner shows the second war as starting around the same time the fourth Amongus invasion begins (third according to the same timelapse) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZvgggcPqGY" target="_blank">Link</a>), but the time I would prefer would be that the second civil war started when Bratishkinoff went offline as he was in control of the situation until that point.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But, there is something interesting about that name, “the second civil war.”
                Is that accurate?
                It&#x2019;s the traditional name for the war, but when I ask what the first civil war was I get different answers.
                Some say it was the lattice wars, others say it was the time when the discord government tried to defend Columbia an other artworks during the reconquest of the corner, and again I pointed out another time when the Blue Corner had a civil war, that Azure Angle incident.
                So there are atleast 3 distinct “Blue Corner Civil Wars” that took place before the second civil war.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So is it really the second?
                Or is it the fourth?
                Well, let&#x2019;s first define what a Blue Corner civil war is before we decide.
                My idea is that a blue corner civil war occurs when the blue corner splits into two sub-factions, both of which view themselves as the Blue Corner, which seek absolutely contradictory goals.
                Usually this comes in the form of disorganized knights from Reddit fighting the Discord faction government.
                The first civil war, under this definition, would indeed be the 2017 civil war which was basically a war over whether or not the Blue Corner would be incorporationist.
                The “Incorporationist war,” to give it a more unique name, was the most similar conflict to the official second civil war, so it makes sense to unequivocally label the 2017 civil war the first civil war of the Blue Corner.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So was the lattice war the second civil war?
                I don&#x2019;t think so.
                Currently, I can&#x2019;t find any evidence that the group which expanded the lattice was related to the Blue Corner in any way and considering the clear contrast between the corner and the lattice, I think you would need a pretty high bar of evidence to justify this.
                The Azure Angle incident, on the other hand, was atleast in part a conflict between Blue Corner sub-factions.
                In this case it was some members of the Discord and potentially some Redditors to trying to change the color of the Blue Corner in spite of the general consensus both on Discord and on Reddit that the Blue Corner ought to not change color.
                So there is a real argument that the Azure Angle incident was the second civil war and this war over Frog-man was really the third.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, I am going to try and be even more technical and divide the Blue Corner civil wars into different series of conflicts.
                Why?
                Well because these names provide some unique information about each war.
                Both the 2017 civil war and the “second” civil war were wars about whether or not the Blue Corner should be incorporationist, so these wars were the first and second incorporationist wars.
                However, the Azure Angle incident was about what it meant for the Blue Corner to be blue, so it was kind of a different series of conflict altogether, fundamentally different.
                Because of that, I will call it the first Shade war as it was a war where we were arguing about what shade of blue we were using.
                But, if we just want to talk about civil wars, Azure Angle incident is the second and the froggy war is the third.
                However, I will refer to the froggy war as “the second blue corner civil war” because everyone else already calls it that and because the Azure Angle incident was so fundamentally different from the other civil wars.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You may think that this second civil war should also be called the second Bratishkinoff war, but it is not, it is called the second civil war.
                Why is this?
                Well, the simple reason is because, even though this war was fought in Bratishkinoff&#x2019;s territory, Bratishkinoff himself never fought the Blue Corner.
                Instead, when he woke up, we were able to explain to him what was going on and he did not destroy us.
                Instead, he simply rebuilt his artwork, went back to a white background, and ended the alliance with the Blue Corner, which was understandable.
                Certainly the Blue Corner was glad he did not take vengeance because, for the entire war, the Discord was drawing knights away from the defense of our territory in order to defend frog-man, so when the civil war was over the Blue Corner had another problem to deal with: an absolutely massive army of Amongi.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Fourth Amongus war (it is listed as the third amongus war on the official timelapse) started in the middle of the second civil war but it took much longer to end.
                The Amongi were originally all Azure with Cyan eyes, but as we fought the Amongi began to change colors and became a disorganized mess of many colors.
                The strategy the Discord used at this time to reclaim the corner was to draw Cyan lines within the corner which told those who only looked at the canvas to “focus anti-griefing efforts here.”
                This strategy turned out to be effective at redirecting the disorganized knights who quickly wiped out large portions of the Amongi army, demoralizing the enemy and causing their defenses to collapse.
                Soon, the blue army outpaced our Cyan line and the Amongi were destroyed.

              </div>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During this time another important event happened in Blue Corner history.
                I proposed the four unit system.
                Why was it so important?
                Basically, the problem with the previous organization of the Blue Corner is that the Blue Corner Discord was really only able to perform one action on the canvas at a time and was only able to tell the disorganized knights to perform one on-canvas action.
                The problem was, we had the manpower to do more, but if we commanded people to do two actions at once nobody would be able to determine which of the two actions they were supposed to help with, so the ability to do multiple actions at a time was very limited.
                The goal of the 4 unit system was very simple: assign everybody responsibilities in how the Blue Corner was supposed to be run so that they would know what kind of problem was their responsibility and what they should let everyone else help with.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The four units are as follows:
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;1-&ensp;The Knights of the True Corner
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;2-&ensp;The Knights of the Blue Logo
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;3-&ensp;The Knights of the Blue Border
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;4-&ensp;The Knights of the Blue Field
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I hope their names are enough description.
                This system basically divided the Blue Corner into 4 districts that each had a unit assigned to it, and this would do wonders for helping the blue corner to rapidly respond to situations in an organized and effective manner, though it is not without its flaws.
                I could write an essay dealing with them and preparing for the future here, but I think it is best to show how the 4 units operated and what they achieve before I discuss further improvements.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After the 4 unit system was proposed, people on Discord rapidly began to self-organize into the various units.

              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you were unit 1 you would add “true corner knight” to you nickname and list your number x/10 or x/13.
                Originally, I thought the true corner knights needed ten members so originally every single member listed which one they were, when they joined essentially.
                However, the other knights at one point decided in our unit thread that we should have 13, not 10 members.
                I didn&#x2019;t approve this, but just as the whole unit system was unofficial at this time, I also had no official power to stop this.
                I don&#x2019;t think unit 1 ever reached 13 members during 2022, the members were
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Scout107, 1/10 (myself)
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Zoe (unknown number, likely 2/10)
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Magoulas (unknown number)
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;(Forgotten)
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Cheeseface, 5/13
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;(Forgotten)
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;TheTrueCole, 7/10

                <br>&emsp;&emsp;Mister Two Scoops 12/13?
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;According to my best count, the Knights of the True Corner had 12 members in 2022, but I also know there was atleast one man who defended the true corner even though the unit was “full” at that time and he likely did so to the end of place, so I guess I will count him as the honorary 13th.

              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The other units just added “Unit 2” “Unit 3” or “Unit 4” to their name during the time when there were no roles as membership in those units was not supposed to be limited.
                After the proposal, the 4 unit system quickly grew in popularity within the Discord until the mods finally made official roles for each of the units, gave us threads, and actually started directing us by unit.
                For the rest of r/place, the True Corner Knights tried to understand their single pixel as best as they could and defend it, but the rest of the units played a real role in the story.

                Disorganized knights began breaking through our border, expanded into the frog-man art, and when it reach a critical point, frog-man fought back.
                This time, though, the disaster was not as great as the first war.
                In order to communicate that the expansion was unintentional, unit 3 began to build a new border 7 pixels to the right of the old border, ceding a small strip of land to the streamer in order to end the war and to make future conflict less likely.
                However, this change in our border also resulted in the “r” in our logo disappearing because we had moved the logo seven pixels to the left in the earlier conflict.
                Unit 2 quickly got to work moving the logo to the right and finished it long before the end.

                The first major grief was when someone placed a large, amorphous brown mass on top of our logo.
                Then, there was a grief where someone tried to write black letters on us.
                Then, for a brief moment, we were attacked by someone trying to draw a foxface.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Then, shockingly, the color palette became white and white alone.
              The Blue Corner was one of the first to go due to its location.
              Outside of our corner, the great french flag was also quickly destroyed.
              In response, France tried to write “France” in big white letters to get the final word, but their opponents changed it to “free.”
              A big white heart grew in the middle as a laser shout out of the mouth of one piece, Rays shout out from each corner and crossed until, finally, everything came together and went back to a blank space.

              The Legacy of the 2022 Blue Corner
            </div>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Part of the reason I wrote such a comprehensive history of the Blue Corner from beginning to today is because I believed that the legacy of the 2022 Blue Corner was important to understanding the 2023 Blue Corner and that I was the person most capable of telling this portion of the story.
              Even though the fundamental politics of the Blue Corner has been decided, back in 2017, the organization of the Blue Corner in 2017 and in 2023 are very different, and 2022 is the year where that transition began.
              If you went on the Blue Corner Discord a while back, at the start of this event even, you would have found the roles “offense” and “defense,” but today those roles no longer exist as the 4 unit system not only began to sit alongside, but entirely replaced that system of organization which was a relic of the imperial era.
              I will explain why later, in 2023 when that actually occurred.
              Now, the 4 unit system is the way that the Blue Corner is organized, and 2022 was when it started.
              Since I started it, it only seems reasonable for me to cover the story of how that happened.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But the 4 unit system isn&#x2019;t all that the Blue Corner is.
              The Blue Corner also has politics and political parties.
              First there was the dispute between incorporationists and purists during the Blue Empire, then the dispute between the Logoists and Cornerists when we fell, and then the double-binary of incorporationist vs. purist and monumentalist vs. imperialist that defines Blue Corner politics to this day.
              But that all came from 2017, and we didn&#x2019;t change that.
              Infact, we only reinforced the legacy 2017 gave us.
              Incorporationism consistently failed to gain a foothold within our corner and imperialism was consistently repressed further establishing our monumentalist-purist identity.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, we also got to make our own decisions in 2022 that would define how we operated in the future.
              Firstly, were we bottom-right?
              The answer was yes, yes we were.
              When the canvas expanded, we discarded our old territory and held on to the new corner because it was not the land we were on, but the corner itself which mattered.
              Could we move to a different corner that moved less?
              No, we were bottom right.
              Could we change color?
              No, we must remain true blue as the Azure Angle incident showed.
              Cornerness, Blueness, and bottom-rightness are the three uncompromisable positions of the True Corner.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Though...
              What does blueness mean exactly?
              Does it mean we must use one exact shade?
              Can the shade change depending on what colors are available?
              If so, when?
              2022 did not answer those questions, but 2023 will raise and answer many questions regarding blueness and have its own important legacy to parse out.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Place, in 2022, was far more popular than place 2017, and by extension place alternatives were much larger and more notable between the 2nd and 3rd iteration of place.
            The most notable place alternative is our/place, a place alternative made by the streamer Ludwig where he had people come together to make his channel art.
            There were two iterations of our/place between the 2nd and 3rd place, both of which are very interesting.
            Another notable place alternative is pxls.space.
            It is notable in general because it is one of the longest lasting place alternatives with one of the more dedicated fanbases, so that is why I include it. But, the biggest reason I am discussing pxls.space is because I know alot about it since I ran the most recent Blue Corner faction on that website.
            I am also aware that the Blue Corner was on rplace.tk, a place alternative where you can place a pixel every second, but I don&#x2019;t know if it has an interesting history.
            Also, pixelplace.io is another popular place alternative that probably emerged in the first inter-place period and is still running today, but I don&#x2019;t know in what places the blue corner has a history over there, so I will only be discussing our/place and pixls.space.
            I would be pleased if people who knew more about the Blue Corner on other place alternatives would provide information about our history on those other sights.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;our/place produced what is most likely the single most important place alternative canvas.
              Of all place alternatives I could find, it appears to have had the most participants of any alternative canvas... ever.
              Not only that, but our/place was the first collaborative canvas the astounding “bad apple” timelapse appeared in. Touhou wasn&#x2019;t able to finish the timelapse before our/place ended, but the fact that they did aswell as they did let them know, and showed everyone, that such complex animation on r/place was possible.
              The momentum of the our/place bad apple timelapse ultimately carried over to r/place 2023 where Touhou created a complete version of the bad apple animation on r/place.
              Besides bad apple, there is also the notable bullet bill animation that came from this timelapse.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But, besides these things, the Blue Corner also had a history on our/place, though I personally don&#x2019;t have access to any information that is not visible on the timelapse, so I will keep it brief.
              The canvas expanded twice to fit the channel art aspect ratio, both times it expanded to the right which means the Blue Corner had 3 corners in our/place, just like in r/place 2022.
              The first corner was the largest by far, but the bottom region of the corner quickly got taken over by Amongi and then the whole region was covered up by smaller artworks.
              The second corner had it worse as it was immediately covered over by Ludwig&#x2019;s massive self-portrait that took up the bottom half of the first expansion.
              However, once Ludwig stopped defending said self-portrait, other smaller communities continually kept the Blue Corner out of the Bottom-right.
              Eventually, the Blue Corner made a breakthrough while Norway was on the bottom-right, but the canvas quickly expanded forcing them to move right away.
              After this, the Blue Corner was turned into a “loading” bar surrounded by black pixels which means that the true corner of our/place was not true blue at the end.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, on pxls.space, the true corner would often be made blue by the communities which defended it.
              Just like in the first inter-place period, the Blue Corner on pxls.space between 2022 and 2023 was not always governed by the same community, and it also did not exist on every canvas, but there are many canvases in which the Blue Corner did achieve it&#x2019;s goals.

              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The first appearance of the Blue Corner on pxls.space during the second inter-place period occurred right after place ended in April of 2022.
                At that time, the canvas that was active on pxls.space was Canvas 55, a rectangular canvas (something not to common for that website believe it or not).
                However, the Blue Corner was not the only faction from place to come over during that time.
                Foxhole also made a brief appearance for example, but the Green Lattice was already a fixture on pxls.space long before place 2022.
                Now, the blue corner, despite it&#x2019;s presence, did not make a big splash.
                Infact, the pxls.space wiki has an article that covers the place invasion, but it does not even reference the blue corner because it was that insignificant.
                (<a href="https://wiki.pxls.space/index.php?title=Place_Invasion#Canvas_56" target="_blank">Link</a>)
                However, the Blue Corner can just be made out on the canvas timelapse if you look close enough.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Very little happened on pxls.space in terms of the blue corner since then until something else happened, namely until I arrived.
                I did try and make a small blue corner on canvas 61 myself, but I quickly gave up, and when canvas 62 came around I got bored and moved on.

                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Then I came back to pxls.space around 2/3rds of the way into canvas 63... and what did I see? Six square canvases.
                  I knew immediately that I had to make those six corners blue.
                  So I did.
                  Because of pxls.space only having a 30 second cool-down, it was easy for a single person like myself to build up six blue corners without help, so I didn&#x2019;t call on anyone to help right away, but eventually I got myself in a battle to big for me and I needed to call on someone.

                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The faction Polepxls had taken over the bottom-right section of the blue sub-canvas on canvas 63, the bottom-right most canvas and the truest corner in a sense, but I was still trying to place on it anyways.
                  Eventually, I got annoyed and tried to negotiate with them, trying to get atleast 1 pixel of blue on the corner.
                  There was no way that they would negotiate and some of them are still salty about the whole affair.
                  Anyways, instead of negotiating, they decided to destroy the other five corners I had been building up, which was terrible, I could not fight them...

                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;So I called on the Blue Corner subreddit and asked you all to come and assist.

                  I eventually got accused of botting because of all the new accounts appearing to help me, it took a little bit of convincing to show people I was recruiting from off the Blue Corner subreddit.
                  However, I could not recruit enough knights to beat pokepxls, so I eventually had to end up joining a larger faction, the Chromatic Empire, to end the war with pokepxls.
                  This required me giving up the corner on the blue square for the rest of the canvas, but there were still 5 squares with corners.

                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What happened after that was... quite the drama if I am honest.

                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The most historically important blue corner on canvas 63 is the orange square.
                  If you look at the article, most of the words were written about this.
                  The reason why the orange square is so important is because one of the people that joined: CreepyFR.
                  I was trying to make a blue corner faction that was monumentalist and artistic, we weren&#x2019;t becoming a background but we were making our own blue-corner themed artpieces.
                  CreepyFR, on the other hand, was imperialist, something that pxls players hated.
                  He attacked a community called “rogers” which was right above the Blue Corner on the orange square and I often had to defend their art.
                  Eventually, he left the faction I was making which, at the time, was called “The Blue Corner” (TBC) and he joined a separate faction called Blue Corner.
                  Well, after that CreepyFR essentially disappeared, but I was still required by the Chromatic Empire to change the name of the faction to something that wouldn&#x2019;t confuse us with him, so I changed the faction name to “the Knights of the Blue Corner” (KotBC), and this name has stuck so far for the duration of this revival (which appears to be the seventh).
                </p>
                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, even after we officially became a more pxls friendly faction, there were still plenty of people who hated us that we had to fight over and over again.
                  Eventually, we lost the blue corner to left, a fairly important player, who turned the orange square blue corner into the Green Corner, changing the nice Snowflake and banner we had in that corner to an upside-down smile and a perverted nuclear snowflake.

                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During and after this very formative period, I did essentially dictate many points of the ideology of the faction.
                  The first point is that we were trying to be a pxls friendly version of the Blue Corner, so we were not going to grief art, we were going to be a background to art, and we were going to make art ourselves.
                  However, we would also remain the Blue Corner.
                  We would always remain the bottom-right corner and we would also keep the true corner blue.
                </p>
                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I also established a system of government for the faction which fit with pxls space.
                  Basically, the blue corners of the knights were not treated as simple monuments, but were treated as pieces of art in their own right, ones which could not violate the principles of the corner, but ones which should also show creativity.
                  Because of this, different sections of faction territory were divided up between the members of the faction to do with them what they would like.
                  They were “canvas marshalls” coming up with blue corner artworks over and over again.
                </p>
                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The most important piece of art the faction has developed is the Knight of the Blue Corner made by meepleomg.
                  This artpiece was the centerpiece of the Blue Corner on canvas 64 and has made returns since then.
                  It is one of the three emoji&#x2019;s present on the server and the most commonly used as it just looks the best.

                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The second major artpiece is the blues-eye, namely because of how much of a failure it was.
                  It was created on canvas 64a, a transitional canvas, where essentially we were trying to come up with the smallest Blue Corner possible that still fit within the ideology of the Knights.
                  The answer was the blues-eye.
                  It is important because, ever since canvas 67, it has defined the minimum size of a corner (4x4) and because it also acts as a symbol of monumentalist-incorporationism, the idea that the Blue Corner should be limited in size and incorporate art.
                  The blue background (8 pixels) which includes the true corner represents the essential blueness of the corner, the true corner being blue represents how it must remain blue, the azure pixel in the middle surrounded by the 8 blue pixels represents the artwork we were incorporating and creating, and the azure border represents our rejection of imperialism.
                </p>
                <p class="content-p">
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, on canvas 64a, the blues-eye had a bad run because the griefers we consistently fought saw it as a target, literally.
                  They used this same excuse to attack the blues-eye lattice on canvas 65, but the blues eye has successfully made appearances in Canvas 66 and 67.
                  It is mainly used as a tool to ensure the true corner is blue when the overall design would otherwise not allow for a true blue corner.

                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Knights of the Blue Corner experienced the most success on canvas 66.
                  Ever since Canvas 65, the knights had been trying to change to a lattice design which would have hopefully made them more respectable to the community of pxls.space, but their canvas 65 attempts at this failed.
                  However, greenwizard did design a good looking lattice for canvas 66 and we ultimately took over a massive territory on canvas 66 with this lattice design.
                  All three of the major artworks show up along with a “TBC” banner.
                  The blues eye is on the lower corner where the lattice design would have otherwise made it azure.

                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The final canvas I fought on was Canvas 67.
                  During this canvas, we were on a heart shape.
                  I eventually decided there was no true corner, but eventually the user Proplayen made a lattice design for the bottom corner of the heart and the faction joined him.
                  Another knight, Ramen-hair, also built a unique lattice design for the Blue Corner.
                  I also began to experiment with the small 4x4 squares, coming up with abstract blue corner artpieces in a row of squares called the gallery.
                  The bottomlands were controlled by Proplayen, I also called Ramen-hairs design the Ramen-hairritory, and both of these territories survived to the end of Canvas 67 (though someone did a good job of wiping out the bottomlands).
                  However, the gallery itself was destroyed with one possible exception.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Overall, the Blue Corner had a good run on pxls.space this period, I would daresay even better than last year.
                There is plenty of evidence that the Blue Corner&#x2019;s legacy was powerful enough to inspire multiple people to try their own hand at independently making a blue corner on the site, but the Knights of the Blue Corner is by far the most consistently successful version of the faction so far on pxls.space.
                I personally don&#x2019;t plan on returning to the faction myself because the short cooldowns and long run times of canvases makes it very difficult to spend a reasonable amount of time on these projects and I have better games to play, but I sure do hope the faction does evolve in the future especially now that the Green Lattice is gone.
                I personally think that the Knights of the Blue Corner has alot of potential on pxls.space and, for obvious reasons, I would love to see it become the longest lasting iteration of the Blue Corner on that website.
                It isn&#x2019;t yet, but it could get there.
                It is certainly the most well documented iteration.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But I will not forget, there is another r/place alternative, namely ludwigs second iteration of his our/place canvas.
              This canvas had a unique twist because, instead of expanding, it continuously shrank to fit smaller and smaller aspect ratios.
              It&#x2019;s clear from the timelapse that, initially, the Blue Corner tried to claim the true corner in every aspect ratio, or atleast in the wide tv version and the small phone version.
              However, the Blue Corner only has a notable presence on the TV channel art, and even then the true corner is not blue, while as the canvas shrank and the area meant for phones was more heavily contested the blue corner was firmly pushed out.

            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Right after Place 2022 ended, there was some debate among the Reddit community about what next year&#x2019;s april fools event would be.
              Would it be place or something else?
              How many people would have predicted it would be something else and place?
              Even though place 2022 was my first Reddit April Fools event, I did not want place to return in 2023 primarily because I had missed out on the unique (though worse) April Fools events Reddit had done in other years and, simply put I wanted to participate in my own share of new and interesting sitewide games.
              However, as time passed, the dataminers declared that place was returning in 2023, so half disappointed that nothing unique would happen, and half excited to see how the 4 unit system would function over the course of a full event, I, like everyone else, began to prepare.
              However, I am not someone who liked to follow Reddit news a whole lot, so I missed out on most of the drama that led up to the anticipation of place.
              When April Fools finally did come around, we were greeted with r/schrodingers which was... worse than place.
              Honestly, I&#x2019;m not made, I knew the chances of Reddit coming up with something better than place was next to nothing, but schrodingers was unique, even if people quickly realized that almost nobody could meaningfully participate in the event.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Now, people still expected Place to happen sometime this year, so people waited. Reddit&#x2019;s anniversary started being thrown around as a possible date, then that passed with nothing happening.
              Then, Reddit announced the idiotic changes to 3rd party API, and soon after that, announced that place was returning.
              Place, returning, at this time left many people with a sour taste in their mouths.
              The fact that Reddit was bringing place back at this time felt like Reddit was trying to placate the community, throwing it a meaningless bone so that it would ignore the very significant, permanently devastating changes to 3rd party API.
              Given these fact, it&#x2019;s quite obvious that a new faction would form, or really a protest that almost every faction on place would participate in one way or another.
              The Blue Corner would also participate, though the protest would not be that important to our history.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Specifically “blue” was wrong.
                At the start of place, we only had access to a small handful of colors, far less than in place 2017, and the “blue” we had access to was more a form of Azure leaning towards Cyan than true blue.
                It was probably not to intentional, but one way or another Reddit forced us to become the wrong color by limiting our color palette.
                Though we, of course, called ourselves “the Blue Corner” we were more of an Azure angle.
                This bothered me, I&#x2019;m not sure it bothered anyone else, but it was the way of things at the time.
                The fact that we were also forced to use this shade of blue also caused us to have a very natural alliance with the group known as “ragged insomniacs.”
                The album of the same title just so happened to have a pure Azure cover that fit with the “blue corner” design of early 2023.
                They were a small faction, but they likely did contribute in part to our manpower pool.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I had deleted all my place related Discords earlier in the year, but as soon as I realized the even was going on, I rejoined the Blue Corner discord and reclaimed my place as unit 1 leader, author of the first history of 2022, founder of the 4 unit system, and so-on.
                I came in with the goal of helping the Blue Corner to further organize in a productive way, and I felt it was important to reclaim this reputation in order to get people to listen to me, and this did turn out to be effective to the degree that I got more and more people to organize via the 4 unit system.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But, the main problem with the Blue Corner Discord early on had nothing to do with the fact that the people were disorganized, the problem was that the mods were inactive.
                More specifically, there was only one active member of the mod team for most of day 1: TheRageBot.
                Other members of the mod team would slowly become active, but over half the old mod-team was inactive for the entire event, only observing.
                This made The Blue Corner Discord a practical dictatorship, but I wasn&#x2019;t going to accept that as, when I joined, it seemed quite clear to me the faction was governed more by consensus than by mod and admin decrees.
                Besides that, the decisions of TheRageBot and other admins such as Night1172, Hythe666, and SkedT (which made up the “early 2023 government”) were consistently controversial and constantly conflicted with the consensus formed in the Blue Corner vc.
              </p>
              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Besides the mod team, the people in the voice chat were essentially the second most powerful governing body in the Blue Corner.
                The voice chat could easily and quickly develop consensus about issues, it would send out it&#x2019;s own men to discuss diplomatic deals, and it would work together to make sure everyone on the Discord was on the same page even if they did not have access to the announcement page.
                The early history of the Blue Corner in 2023 was essentially dominated by situations where the voice chat and the mod team came into conflict as users in the voice chat formed “unofficial” treaties and deals that conflicted with those made by mods and diplomats.
                This conflict was further amplified by the fact that the Admin “TheRageBot” was often in the VC and rarely stopped the unofficial actions of the vc giving the users of the vc some sense of legitimacy in their actions.
                However problematic this may be, after witnessing the power the VC has to act as an effective government even without mod oversight has convinced me that a VC based governmental body should absolutely be established within the Blue Corner for future events, and we should call it “the assembly.”
                It may need to be a stage instead of a vc, but whatever the case, vc is an important part of organizing factions on place.

              <p class="content-p">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Partially in response to this instability, and partly to refine the 4 unit system, I proposed a reform to the 4 unit system where we have formal unit leaders inspired by my previous pxls.space faction, “the Knights of the Blue Corner,” but my initial proposal was not really the best.
                You can read it here:
                (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJc8VmNpeib1nEH7oxYaoDkWZgRvKQ2z4HoqcPGlt10/edit" target="_blank">Link</a>)
                The reform was not, and should not, be fully implemented, but the idea that each unit should have leaders was eventually mostly implemented.
                I quickly became the de-facto leader of unit 1 even though I was not a mod.
                Two people: TheStruggleIsALie and SwingTheVine became important leaders in Unit 2.
                These three along with “King Gamer 273” quickly became important non-mod leaders at this time having de-facto political power.
                None of us contradicted mod announcements, though we did try to get mod announcements to go our way, and when mods did announce things we did try to enforce their decisions because the mods were the leaders, nonetheless we did represent a second political faction within the Blue Corner which was essentially pushing for greater democratization of Blue Corner affairs.
                I also tried to include TheRageBot in the system I was creating.
                Most of his announcements had to do with Unit 3, so I asked him to lead the unit, but he decided to not be official about that despite the fact that, early on, almost of his commands were directed at unit 3.
