          <p class="content-p">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;r/place 2023, it was great guys.
            I had a great time in the Blue Corner this year, but now it is over.
            But, before I forget, I want to talk about what happened here so that we do not have to forget.
            This year was very dramatic and eventful and some even say the Blue Corner got the best story this year whether you know it or not.
            I am personally not the kind of person to say one piece of history is better than another, but this year sure has a poetic narrative that is easy for me to craft.
            Despite the fun we had though, and despite the lore that came out of it, I think most of us can agree that this was the worst r/place event to date.
            It took too long, was fairly derivative, started with a bad color palette, was infested with bots, and most of all it was simply meant to distract us from recent Reddit API changes.
            If you noticed, this year the logo for the blue corner and many other factions did not contain “r/” as part of that protest.
            We were no longer advertising subreddits, but communities that transcended reddit.
            This is the story of one of those communities, the Blue Corner.
          </p>
          <p class="content-p">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Now, I could just go into 2023, but I don&#x2019;t want to.
            I joined the Blue Corner last year in 2022, in the middle of the Tarik invasion.
            I joined because I hated the fact that he was turning the Blue Corner red, not so much because I was angry he attacked the Blue Corner, but because the red corner, if it is to exist, belongs in the top-right, not the bottom-right, so I was fine with this.
            After place ended I quickly wrote down my perspective on the 2022 event in a “partial history of the Blue Corner.” which is in the subreddit archives.
            Now, having been part of this community for a full year and then some, I want to do the opposite and write a “complete history of the Blue Corner”
            I have been doing some research this last year and I hope I can present a history of the blue corner that covers the three place events thus far, and then some.
            In this history I will also discuss place alternatives, because why not, but I hope to link to more complete histories at various points.
            Another reason I am doing this is because 2023 has alot of story elements that you cannot really understand unless you know the history of 2022, and many people may not be willing to study it, so I am including it here.
            I wish to explain how each place event affected the faction and how it was replicated in various place alternatives, particularly pxls.space which I am most familiar with, but I hope to focus on place.

              The Faction Dominated Era

            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Blue Corner is a very unique community in r/place history.
              It is part of a very unique group of communities which I will call “factions” that almost all emerged in 2017.
              Artpieces in r/place can very generally be divided into 3 groups: art, proper, which is any art piece that is not simply flag with defined dimensions and a limited size that is usually complex and naturally leaves room for more art; Flags and other national symbols, striped flags in particular can usually expand indefinitely but only in a single direction; and finally factions,
              factions are communities centered around colors or simple patterns that can hypothetically expand in all directions indefinitely, and because of this these factions are usually focused on territorial control.
              There are some gray areas and subgroups and nuances when categorizing communities and art pieces on r/place, but most objects in r/place fit more or less into one of these three categories, and of these three categories, factions are the rarest.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The most notable factions on r/place are the Void, Erase the Place, the Green Lattice, Rainbow road, and last, but most of all, the Blue Corner.
              All of these factions have one, very simple thing in common: they all emerged in 2017, and only in the early stages of 2017, when they were dominant.
              Notable factions that emerged after 2017 are either limited in scope, such as the green line, a linear faction like rainbow road which is more easily incorporated into other artworks, or are griefing tools, such as the purple void Xqc made, or are otherwise streamer made, such as the quackity duck lattice.
              This displays an interesting picture, namely that 2017 had unique conditions that were uniquely favorable to the creation of these iconic factions, conditions that haven&#x2019;t been repeated since, and which will likely never be repeated again.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Early on, during the first place, the timer which forced you to wait 5 minutes to place a pixel was extremely restrictive.
              Most people did not have the patience to create an artwork of any significant size alone, and because people did not know what was coming before the event started, there were no communication tools which helped people organize their pixel placements to “create something more” as the place logo said.
              Because of this, initially the canvas was dominated by random pixels of random colors that were placed in random locations.
              The highest concentration of these random pixels occurred near the center and on every corner except the bottom-right, that&#x2019;s because even though the corners, like the center, were being dominated by chaos, from the very beginning the Blue Corner brought order to the bottom right.
              You can check the interactive time lapse (which is actually a pixel-lapse) for yourself.
              (<a href="https://freestlr.github.io/place/" target="_blank">Link</a>)
              Though the first non-white pixel on the bottom-right corner was not blue, but black, and then red, and then blue, the blue corner was not dominated by chaos at a time when every other corner was.
              Why was the Blue Corner so successful so early on?
              This seems like quite the mystery.
              Why was every other early “corner province” a chaotic assortment of random pixels while the Blue Corner was simply blue?
              The answer for this question may come, of all places, from r/europe.
              It seems that r/europe was the first faction to claim the bottom right corner.
              They sought to make an EU flag, but pretty quickly people started just making the corner blue instead, keeping the stars from getting placed, and eventually r/europe was absolutely incapable of achieving their goals in the bottom-right.
              The idea that the Blue Corner is the result of a failed attempt to build the EU flag is hilarious to me, but it just goes to show you how history can happen.
              (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/62moej/reddit_has_started_a_new_rthebuttonstyle/dfnss3n/" target="_blank">Source</a>)
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Blue Corner that the EU flag turned into quickly became very popular with r/place at around the same time as the great green box.
              Whether or not the Blue Corner or the Great Green Box was first is hard to determine, but most people say the Green box was the first structure to emerge on r/place, and this would make the Blue Corner the second community-made structure ever.
              At this time, the Blue Corner also made a colony near the Green Box which I will call “the outpost,” the location where /u/Andrewcshore315&#x2019;s narrative starts.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Factions similar to the Blue Corner and Great Green Box quickly emerged.
              There was the Rainbow Road, the Green Lattice, the Black Lattice, the Purple Blob, the Square Spiral, the other rainbow, pink lattice, the pink triangle, the pink and cyan square spiral, the yellow lattice, the red corner, and many more.
              Dozens of factions, most of which only appeared on the first r/place, were created as these simple patterns were all most people could co-ordinate in the first day or two of the event.
              Because people were not yet co-ordinated enough to make complex art pieces, the early stages of r/place looked more like a territorial control game, a war between various color-based and lattice factions fighting to be the largest things on the canvas as artwork and the occasional flag slowly formed around them.
              At this time, the Blue Corner was the largest faction, no, the largest community on r/place, and because of this, it became the largest empire on place, it controlled 1/8th of the canvas at its peak.
              This was the golden age of our corner, when nobody would fight us.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our success inspired imitation.
              In the top-right corner, the red corner formed, the second largest corner faction.
              On the bottom-left corner, the green corner formed, a mere alternate location for the Great Green Box faction, and the third largest corner faction.
              But, on the top left, a fourth faction formed, the smallest notable corner faction of 2017: the pink corner.
              The pink corner was a tiny contiguous territory of pixels that controlled roughly 1/5th of its local chaotic corner region before the Blue Corner highway reached the top-left corner.
              This primitive corner faction was not able to bring order to its chaos before it was destroyed by the Blue Corner.
              No, the Blue corner conquered the top-left and created a brand new colony.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The various imitators, primarily the red and green corner, offended the Blue Corner, so our faction decided to invade these corners with pixels of blue.
              These invasions succeeded and directly led to the complete destruction of the red and green corners, when they were covered with art.
              But, the top-left corner was a different story.
              The blue empire lost the top-left corner when the subreddit r/purplepxls organized an army to take over the top-left corner making it the purple corner, the rebel corner, and they beat back the blue.
              When the purple corner rebelled, they were able to succeed because the Blue Corner had not only reached the limit of the territory it could hold on to, despite it&#x2019;s size, but also fought offensive wars against other factions that were taking up precious pixels.
              Erase the place formed, destroying the highway of blue pxls that connected the top-left corner to the bottom right further weakening the Blue Corner&#x2019;s image on the canvas, but this was still the golden age.
              It was simply our first major conflicts: the corner wars, three distinct conflicts, 2 of which we won, one of which we lost, and the highway war which we lost.
              Even still, we grew larger and larger because our home base would not stop growing even as our colony died.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the midst of all these wars we changed our primary subreddit from r/bluecorner to r/thebluecorner, and then shortly after this, war began.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Many people want to go back to this time, they want to make a blue empire to rival the first on r/place, but I am here to be the bearer of bad news.
              That is unachievable.
              It always will be.
              Assuming that reddit gets better at killing bots, whether or not a faction can survive is dependent on how compelling its idea is to the user base of place.
              The fact that no factions are emerging in 2022 and 2023 shows that, now that people are able to co-ordinate, simple color-based, location based, and lattice based ideas are not stuff people are interested in promoting.
              Place-original content is falling out of fashion, people want to bring in stuff they find compelling outside of place.
              There is simply too many placers to make new factions, and because of the fact that factions no longer dominate, and never will, factions can&#x2019;t make enemies unless they commit completely to griefing, and griefing would endanger the true corner making a true “blue empire” a thing of the past.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But, don&#x2019;t think of it as something that will never come again, no.
              Realize that the time when simple patterns and colors dominated r/place was a truly one time thing, a unique experience, the only time colored empires could emerge.
              And what did the Blue Corner do?
              We were the faction that dominated the era when factions dominated the canvas.
              We are the empire of place, and our unique historical achievement can never be repeated by anyone else making us a permanent fixture in place history.
              We are the Blue Corner, we are the empire, and that can never be taken away.
              The Blue Corner, along with Rainbow Road and the Green Lattice, are the three great empires of place 2017, and no empires like us can ever emerge again, but of the three we achieved the largest size, 1/8th of the canvas, even if only for a time.
              The Blue Corner is not an empire, but it had an empire, and it had the best empire.
              We get to claim the title of empire and are more deserving of it than any other faction on place, but now in our current circumstance, we have the chance to claim a second title, a more noble one, the title of survivor.

            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When the Blue Corner was at it&#x2019;s peak, the streamer Destiny came online and he decided that he wanted to destroy us.
              I wonder why.
              Anyways, he told his viewers to target our logo and the true corner.
              His raid, even though it never covered the corner, destroyed our ability to defend ourselves, many of our soldiers were discouraged, and slowly, but surely, the Blue Corner was consumed by a multitude of artworks that took advantage of the chaos created by Destiny&#x2019;s raid.
              Artwork also began to invade the other corners, the red, the green, and the purple, and the green lattice began to change from a white to it&#x2019;s iconic black background.
              All of these changes after Destiny&#x2019;s raid signaled that the age of factions, of empires, of massive color-based expansion was coming to an end and the age of art was beginning.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Most of the factions which emerged early on in r/place were being destroyed at the same time as us, but afew survived, and I find it useful to point out how each of them survived.
              The void survived because it was primarily a nomadic griefing tool. It&#x2019;s original intent was to make the entire canvas black, a very normal goal for a faction, the natural enemy of r/erase the place which wanted to make the canvas white.
              Erase the place, or the white void, had a very different survival strategy.
              After the white void was destroyed by the American flag, erase the place took over a small triangle in the nook of rainbow road, a controlled but deadly force.
              Rainbow road, on the other hand, never collapsed because it&#x2019;s linear design made it able to creatively co-operate with other art pieces.
              Green Lattice, on the other hand, was able to survive by becoming a nice looking background for small allied art pieces while Square Spiral was able to survive the end of the age of factions because it was so large and because it looked good.
              The Blue corner, on the other hand, was as good as dead…
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But we survived.
              Our faction consolidated it&#x2019;s efforts, it focused on rebuilding the logo to tell the world that we were still here and it defended the true corner to show that it would protect its home.
              When it came to defense, the faction was split on whether the logo or the corner was more important to defend, but once the logo was secured the faction was able to carve out a small territory by the true corner and slowly, but surely, reclaimed a small territory for its own under our logo.
              As we reclaimed our territory, we were divided between people who wanted to incorporate some artwork under the logo and those who wished to destroy it all.
              Eventually, those who wanted a clean corner won.
              We were also divided on whether we wanted a blue empire reborn or merely a presence on the canvas, but we were far to deep in the age of art for a new color empire to emerge, so we remained content with our 100x100 space.

              The Legacy of the 2017 Blue Corner

            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The events of 2017 defined the faction in so many ways that can still be felt today.
              Most notably, our basic concept: blue in a corner, comes from 2017, but what that means has changed.
              Originally, we were the blue empire based in the corner, the corner was our home, but we were blue first and foremost, and an empire.
              Our victory was not defined by the purity of our corner as it has been in later ages, but by the size of our faction.
              Our ability to succeed in this way, the fact that we created the largest empire in the age of factions, was very important for ensuring our survival in both 2017 and in later place events.
              Even though we never would, and never could be an empire again, when the age of factions was over each faction needed to come up with a reason why it should survive, and of all the factions that did survive, the Blue Corner is the one that seemed like it should have died.
              Why should we, a faction of pure blue, have the corner?
              What could we do?
              Would we be a background and center of an alliance like green lattice?
              No.
              Would we be creatively incorporated into other artworks like rainbow road?
              No.
              Would we be migrating griefers like the void?
              Definitely not.
              So what were we?
              We became a monument to the continued legacy of the largest empire by portion of canvas controlled in place history, a celebration of all things place.
              We were the faction with the most prestigious legacy, so we had a reason, no, a duty, to survive.
              So we fought back and we claimed our space.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But the blue empire ultimately only gave a reason why we should survive, why we belonged on every place canvas from the first to the third, and if there&#x2019;s a fourth that to.
              But, what would that place look like?
              That was decided in the tumultuous chaos of the reclamation.
              Our faction had many parties that still exist today.
              There are the imperialists on one hand who want to relive the great legacy by creating a new empire, and the monumentalists on the other who desire a sufficient defendable space to honor the great legacy; there are the purists who desire a pure blue corner with no art on the one hand, and there are the incorporationists who desire to let in artwork of various kinds, control it, and make the blue corner a beautiful piece of art in its own right.
              The old empire, according to the 2017 historian /u/sarosauce, was imperialist, but it was also incorporationist, which many people use to justify the position that artwork should be in the modern blue corner.
              However, during the reclamation, the Blue Corner became purist and monumentalist.
              It had too few men to become an empire, but the Discord which is generally monumentalist and incorporationist, did not have enough knights to stop what is called “the reddit hivemind” in the Discord, the hivemind in general is characterized and imperialist and purist.
              The purist tendencies of the non-Discord users outweigh the incorporationist aspirations of the Discord leadership while the simple lack of manpower in the Blue Corner prevented the Blue Corner, both then and now, from becoming an empire a second time, so the Blue Corner is monumentalist and purist today.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There were five years between r/place 1 and r/place 2.
            During this time, nobody knew r/place would return in 2017, but some people, who were usually members of factions, did not want to let place go, they wanted to do it again.
            Because of this, many place alternatives were created, the best of which, in my opinion, is pxls.space.
            There were others, but I will mainly cover this alternative in my history.
          </p>
          <p class="content-p">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Unlike reddit where you can place one pixel every 5 minutes, pxls.space allows you to place one pixel every 30 seconds give or take.
            Besides this, the game is also allows you to store up to 6 pixels which means, if you don&#x2019;t place down a pixel, a hidden timer will slowly count down and give you a second pixel, and a third, and a fourth.
            The space between each pixel takes longer and longer until you have 6 pixels and are not able to gain any more pixels after that point.
            This “pixel chest” unique to pxls.space makes it a very different experience, especially when there is less than a hundred players online at any given time.
            The pxls.space canvases also tend to remain up for about a month before they are taken down and replaced by a brand new canvas which have become increasingly unique over time.
            Some of these canvases are fairly uninteresting and don&#x2019;t play that differently from a square, but many truly unique ideas take place on the pxls.space canvases.
            It is going to be my goal to outline the history of the various “governments” which directed the Blue Corner on pxls.space and what generally happened.
            Again, I don&#x2019;t know enough about other place alternatives from this era to write about them.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Initially, r/TheBlueCorner did not wish to discuss place alternatives on their subreddit, so a new subreddit emerged called r/Blupxls which organized the Blue Corner on pxls.space and other r/place alternatives.
              They had a good showing in canvas 1, but due to an invasion by the greens and a last minute void attack, the Blue Corner on canvas 1 was destroyed.
              On canvas 2, the Blue Corner was not able to gain a foothold due to the power of “the New Pixel Axis,” the villains of the first two canvases, and it remained insignificant on Canvas 3 due to the red lattice.
              On canvas 4, it did not exist because the canvas was a circle.

              The faction would continue in 30 and 30a (a unique transitional canvas that lasted for a very brief period of time) only to be discontinued and then re-continued during canvas 37.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And that is all the Blue Corner did at this time.
              As I write down the history of the Blue Corner on pxls Space I notice just how lackluster each and every one of these revivals are.
              They are each interesting in their own right, but man there is not much information, nor was there much success, in these revivals.
              Many of these revivals were only inspired by the Blue Corner and none of them properly adapted to the conditions of pxls space which inevitably led to their downfall.
              However, the Blue Corner would return to pxls.space, and it would do so better than ever.
              During this first interregnum, the Green Lattice appeared, great or small, on almost every single pxls.space canvas and their ideology became the prominent ideology in pxls.space.
              Pxls.space is a place alternative where every faction draws backgrounds or art or both and backgrounds must always give way to art.
              Each blue corner revival adapted to this meta to some extent, but none were very successful for very long during this period.
              Even though the Green Lattice has been pushed out of pxls.space today, they are still the source of this alternative&#x2019;s modern culture.

            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With our plans intact, we immediately took over a large area in the bottom-right corner.
              While we were expanding, a line of Amongi (people have stopped using this term) invaded our territory which started the first Amongus war, a war we quickly won.
              During this war, we also gained Cosmere as allies and decided to cede some of our territory over to them.
              Besides cosmere, we were also neighbors to Eminem, r/placetrees, a line of turtles, and some Ukraine hearts.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We did not become a massive empire stretching across an eighth of the canvas, but even still at this time we were about the same size as the late Blue Corner in 2017 despite the fact that there were now more people in place.
              We returned, and it is reasonable to ask and answer one more time why we were able to return after a five year hiatus.
              What was so compelling about the Blue Corner that caused people to join it, that caused it to re-appear in 2022?
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I have a few ideas for why the Blue Corner is so compelling.
              Firstly, the Blue Corner on r/place 2017 was so absurd.
              It was so plain!
              How could there be an entire faction dedicated to making a corner blue?
              How could it possibly be this big?
              This stark contrast was a natural advertisement to those on the canvas, an advertisement that would compel many to look deeper, and then they learned of the Blue Empire.
              They learned what a place icon we were, and that made us respected, it showed place that we belonged even if we did not seem to fit at first glance.
              Not only did we belong, we were distinctive, and we as a faction help to define what place is.
              The essential “placeness” of our faction also helped encourage many 2017 veterans to rejoin the corner for the event.
              There is an inherent sense of place-based digital nationalism inherent in this faction which inspires members to fight for the faction again and again, making other artworks seem unimportant and secondary in comparison.
              The sense of loyalty is very strong in this faction, I feel it too, and it is kind of surprising.
              It is fascinating how people can unite over making a corner blue.
              I don&#x2019;t know exactly how this works, but it seems joining the faction helps people identify with a piece of internet history and makes them feel more important than they honestly have a right to be.
              It&#x2019;s all just fun and games, but to some extent it does not feel that way.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I do have to say, as someone who joined this year, the Blue Corner is a fun faction to take seriously in a playful way, as much as that makes sense.
              The faction has an interesting, unique dynamic, clear goals, and has had a unique set of enemies and stories it has had to face throughout the years.
              It is a fun team to play with on place, it is fun to help the team achieve victory in the way that we have defined it.
              It is awesome how we won, in our monumentalist definition of winning, three events in a row, how we achieved our faction goals and were respected for it.
              Even though factions no longer dominate place, we still retain that factional sense of “winning” and “losing” that inspires people to fight and to not give up, to try even when it gets hard, and ultimately to achieve our goals.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Those goals, in this iteration of r/place, were to keep the True Corner blue, keep the logo up, keep the border secure, and keep the land pure.

              &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;The Lattice Wars
            </div>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Blue Corners design was based on its design at the end of r/place 2017.
              At this time, the blue corner was a region of blue pixels surrounded by a light blue, lattice-like border wall which included the faction logo.
              This was a very visually pleasing design, but it backfired.
              The blue lattice border-wall was only partially built during 2017, but it was fully built during the start of 2022.
              Very quickly, this completed lattice gained a mind of its own and started invading the Blue Corner.
              There were three lattice wars in total.
              During the first two, the lattice invaded the Blue corner, the Blue corner fought back, won, and we thought we had it under control, so the war ended.
              We were wrong, so a second war started, then a third.
              When the third war started, we decided this wouldn&#x2019;t stop being a problem, so we decided to destroy our beautiful lattice and replace it with a safe black border instead.
              The offensive which caused the destruction of the blue lattice was called the X-911 offensive after the coordinates where it occurred, X-911y. During this offensive, the “balls 1st division” would attack along the X-911 splitting the Blue Lattice in two.
              The faction would then conquer the northern half of the lattice and then the southern half.
              By this offensive, the lattice was quickly destroyed.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You may notice if you watch the Blue corner timelapse (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZvgggcPqGY" target="_blank">Link</a>) closely that, even though the lattice invaded the Blue Corner four times during the lattice wars, only three wars are counted.
              Well, I believe this is a simple oversight.
              Three lattice wars are counted, but on the timelapse you can see 4 distinct times when the blue lattice clearly expanded into the Blue Corner and one of those occurred during a period labeled “peacetime.”
              The invasion directly after this first war, which I will call “the lost lattice war” was clearly forgotten because it was significantly smaller than all the rest, but you can clearly see on the timelapse the lattice outgrowing itself and the Blue Corner performing tactical decisions to fight it.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Also, you may want to know who was responsible for the Lattice wars.
              The answer is, we don&#x2019;t know. There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be a faction responsible for the four lattice wars on the first corner, thought there almost certainly was some group responsible for the fifth lattice war on the second corner, but we just do not know who that group is, so in the end we say each lattice war was a period in which the Blue Corner saw the lattice as hostile and either defended against it or attacked it, but we do not know if there was a faction that had a constant attitude of aggression towards the Blue Corner that would make this all one conflict.
              You will note late on in this history in 2023 that, when I discuss Zugu, I will say that though there were multiple distinct invasions, like with the lattice wars, it was all one war because Zugu was aggressive toward us for a continuous period that encompassed all the invasions making every invasion a single long war.
              Other wars, such as the Amongi wars and the Bratishkinoff wars were distinct wars because they were not prolonged periods, but distinct episodes of conflict.
              I will note that essentially every conflict the Blue Corner experienced during r/place 2022 was a distinct episode and not a prolonged period, however it is quite interesting that all the lattice wars occurred at a single period when no other conflict occurred.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One of the most interesting questions about the lattice wars is simple.
              Why was it that, during the lattice wars, the Blue Corner was only griefed by the Blue Lattice?
              This is an interesting question because I think it reveals something about the psychology of griefers.
              As events in the future will show, some people just don&#x2019;t like the Blue Corner, and they generally say it is because the corner is so plain.
              Some people probably saw this design right next to the blue corner, said “this is prettier” and decided to expand it into the blue corner instead of building their own art because this alternative design was already well established.
              When other griefers saw the design expanding into the blue corner, they didn&#x2019;t so much care about making their own distinctive mark as joining a side that seemed it was already bringing the blue corner down.
              The Blue Lattice, in it&#x2019;s short history, even though it griefed the Blue Corner, also seemed to protect the Blue Corner from other griefs, and evidence for this griefing lightning rod of the blue lattice can also be found in the next episode, the QRMongus war, which might be the best proof that the Blue lattice, despite all it&#x2019;s problems, helped to keep our corner clean, potentially more than it hurt?
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I personally find it quite sad that the lattice was destroyed.
              It was a nice, distinctive border that really added to the aesthetic of the corner.
              If I had the power, I could bring it back.
              But such beauty seems to come at the price of constant war, and this price was ultimately something we were unwilling to pay, so we gave up our blue lattice and exchanged it for a boring, generic, but safe single pixel border.
              Originally, the border was a shade of blue, but eventually it became and remained a generic black border.
              But the black border did save us from being invaded by our own border, but the thin border also made territorial disputes with our neighbors more common, so it has its tradeoffs which never perfectly prevented civil war.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After the Lattice was destroyed, a curious event happened.
              The void returned, a fact that is not too surprising considering the fact that some people will always want to see the world burn.
              However, the surprising fact is that members of the Blue Corner Discord apparently performed an unprovoked raid on the Void&#x2019;s Discord server needlessly antagonizing them.
              The balls 1st division, the ones that performed the x-911 offensive, was responsible for this idiotic Discord raid.
              Even though they did good for us at the start, man was this dumb, and even though the Blue Corner diplomats were able to smooth over the situation, it still caused the void to temporarily declare us enemies.

            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Besides this unseemly event, right after the Blue Lattice was destroyed, the amount of “confetti” in the corner started to grow rapidly while we also began to infringe on the territory of neighboring communities.
              Then, it became clear that a vast multitude of assorted communities were expanding into our corner, possibly seeing the destruction of the lattice as a sign of “expansionists intentions” among the Blue Corner.
              Soon, it became clear that the rickroll QR code was the most powerful community of invaders, so we quickly made a deal with them to allow them a place in our corner in exchange for them shrinking the size of their QR code and moving it away from the true corner.
              We would eventually make a second deal to change the location of the code and change it to a shade of blue, but this plan would fall apart when the first expansion occurred.

              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/u/chippejosh notes 4 distinct groups who invaded our corner at this time:
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;1.&ensp;The QR code
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;2.&ensp;A collection of Amongi
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;3.&ensp;Rogue trees
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;4.&ensp;Miscellaneous groups.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The miscellaneous groups can be distinguished by the distinct artworks they made, but there is atleast 17 unique co-ordinated groups expanding in the Blue besides the three already directly specified, and on top of this the last remnant of the Blue Lattice on the top right beside the logo expanded into the Blue Corner meaning that the fifth lattice war, by my count, but not by the traditional count, also occurred at this time.
              I believe that the most common name for this period of chaos is the “QR code war,” but I prefer what I believe to be the second most popular term for this war “the QRMongus war.”
              The first name comes from the fact that the QR code was the principle enemy of the Blue Corner, but it should be noted that for a large portion of this conflict we had a treaty with the QR code and were at war with other factions for most of the period.
              The name “QRMongus” is a combination of the 2 principle invaders of the war, the QR code and Amongi and signals the fact that there were multiple groups involved in this war, but you would have to study to know that during this conflict the Blue Corner was technically invaded by atleast 20 distinct groups of various sizes and confetti all at the same time.
              However, for future reference I will also need to note that this war technically includes both the second Amongus war and the Fifth Lattice War.

            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After we made peace with the QR code, we defeated the second most relevant enemy, the Amongi, and then cleared out the miscellaneous invaders.
              Once we dealt with the miscellaneous groups, we were in a better position to make a deal with the QR code and have them move to the bottom left of our territory and change to Azure and Blue instead of black and white.
              However, we never pushed the rogue trees out of the Logo region they overran partly because they were strong, but mainly because the canvas expanded shortly after this.
              The rogue trees ultimately kept the land they conquered, the only invader to gain any permanent territory, as when the canvas expanded we gave our old territory to Quebec, a flag that was in the center of the original canvas but was pushed out due to constant war with other factions.
              In an almost poetic twist of fate, us handing over the old blue corner to them would cause them to not only gain a permanent and largely undisputed territory, but it also placed them in the exact center of the final canvas making their early defeat in those “king of the hill wars” that took place in the early central canvas be their ticket to become the undisputed king of the top of the final hill.
              Quebec, you are welcome.
              I am glad our old corner turned into you.
              This, in a sense, gave both us and you a prominent position in the center of the final canvas, but it was ultimately the whims of fate that gave this gift to us.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p">
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am both sad and glad that the canvas expanded at this time.
              The reason I am sad is because the QR Code was the only faction that has ever offered to build art on the blue corner that is strong enough to keep it there.
              If we had remained on that corner longer and been forced to accept the QR code, then that might have been a catalyst to reform the blue corner and help make it incorporations.
              After that, in both 2022 and 2023, opportunities never arose to make the blue corner an art friendly place, to make it incorporate some artworks in a unique way.
              Yes, the Amongi were ultimately strong enough to force their way into our corner, but they were ultimately to repetitive and dominating for us to allow them in the corner.
              On to five amongi positioned in a clever way meant to play out some scene in the blue corner would be something I could appreciate, but you cannot hide amongi in the blue corner and the Amongus community was not very creative with how they placed them so they were nothing but a rash on the pure blue canvas.
              The QR code was the first artwork that had a real chance of being incorporated into the core territory of the Blue Corner ever since the first Blue Corner civil war back in 2017, and ever since then the Blue Corner has never had a chance to creatively incorporate artwork inside it.
              But I am also glad that the Blue Corner moved and that the expansions happened because of the stories they opened, and because the expansions also helped to sate the expansionist appetites of other communities which helped the Blue Corner to keep the role on r/place it had carved out for itself.
