          From information to overlays, we have it all!

              We are a group formed from Reddit's "Place" April Fools event.
              The Blue Corner dedicates itself to a single purpose: making the bottom right corner of the canvas blue.
              Our group is one of a few r/place communities that are not tied to any country or trademarked media.
              We just like blue corners!
              Although the result stays the same, the process we use to accomplish the blue corner changes.
              The Blue Corner started as a Reddit community.
              Later, we moved to Discord and began establishing a chain of command.

              Is your community interested in allying with us?
              If you are a diplomat looking to form that alliance, join our Discord!
              We have a diplomatic channel through which we handle negotiations.
              If you are an official diplomat/staff member of your community, you can also request the "Official Foreign Diplomat" role.
              This role helps speed up processing future requests made by your community.

          Chain of Command
        </div>
        <p class="content-p">
          Our chain of command consists of two layers: Congress and Units.
          Each layer has its own leaders who actively collaborate with other groups in the same layer.
          People in a group take orders from their leader.
          The leader takes orders from higher-ranking layers.

            Congress

          <p class="content-p">
            Congress is the highest-ranking layer.
            Its job is to govern and provide direction during events, ensuring they run smoothly.
            Although it may seem simple, this requires a lot of experience and communication. 
          </p>

            <p class="content-p">
              The leading body of Congress is the community's admins and moderators.
              Staff in this position are excellent at leadership and handling high-stress situations.
              They embody The Blue Corner's core values and keep the community a fun place for everyone.
              Their job is to manage and upkeep the Blue Corner community across all its social media platforms.
              Staff discuss problems and decide what path the community should take.

              The role of diplomats is to gather and maintain healthy alliances with other communities.
              This group excels in communication and professionalism.
              They are allowed to speak on behalf of The Blue Corner and have a deep understanding of its values.
              The job of a diplomat consists of reaching out to communities to foster an alliance.
              They also serve as a bridge for allies to speak to The Blue Corner.
              Diplomats commonly receive and relay requests made by allies.
              Diplomats also advise Congress on decisions that may affect allies of The Blue Corner.

            Scout107 created the "Unit" system.
            A "Unit" is a small group dedicated to completing a single task.
            These groups are highly informal.
            Anyone can join or leave a Unit or be in multiple Units simultaneously.
            In addition, a Unit may not have a leader (or may have several leaders).
            However, Unit leaders are always both Congress members and recognized leaders by the Unit they lead.
            Leaders of Units (or Congress) may temporarily assign Units to work on a specific mission unrelated to their Unit's primary purpose.

                This Unit is the core Unit of the five.
                The purpose of this group is to keep the bottom right corner pixel blue.
                Led by Scout107, Unit 1 defends against constant attacks.
                This Unit is more relaxed than others.
                Although it requires little communication or coordination, all appreciate this Unit.

                This Unit is the face of The Blue Corner and is responsible for maintaining the logo.
                The logo changes occasionally but always consists of the text "THEBLUECORNER."
                Led by SwingTheVine, this Unit defends against people looking to deface The Blue Corner.
                This Unit is fast-paced and requires lots of coordination.
                Using the overlay is recommended because the logo is detailed.

                This Unit is responsible for maintaining the border of The Blue Corner's territory.
                Led by Nexiy, this group is responsible for keeping the border pixels blue.
                In addition, if the border encroaches on our neighbor's territory, this group helps repair their art.
                They also repair any hearts that form on our border with our neighbors.
                This Unit does not require a lot of coordination.
                However, it requires a lot of communication.
                As the border spans a giant area, it requires diligence in observing different regions of the border to ensure they are intact.

                This Unit, which is responsible for an enormous area, requires a lot of communication and coordination to clean it.
                In addition, this Unit frequently assists other Units.

                When Congress accepts an ally's request for help, Unit 5 is assigned to clean up their art.
